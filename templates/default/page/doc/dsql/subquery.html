<h1>Sub-Queries, Expressions and Object Management</h1>

<p>When you execute expr() it will create a new query with specified expression and return the reference to you. This is used in some cases such as "or" argument. Calling $q->orExpr() will return an empty query, with a special template which is then used to render sequence of OR-connected conditions.</p>

<p>Sub-queries does not need to be produced from the same object. Let's assume that you have a method which returns query listing all bonuses of particular employee</p>

<?Code?>
function getBonus($employee_id){
    $q = $this->dsql()->table('bonuses');
    $q->field($q->expr('sum(bonus)'));
    $q->where('id',$employee_id);
    return $q;
}
<?/?>

<p>An obvious usage of such a function would be:</p>

<?Code?>
echo getBonus(123)->getOne();
<?/?>

<p>It is however possible to use the function to generate a sub-query without any modifications:</p>

<?Code?>
$q = $this->dsql()->table('employee');
$q->field('name,surname');
$q->field(getBonus($q->getField('id')),'bonuses');

foreach($q as $row){
    echo $row['name'].': '.$row['bonuses']."\n";
}
<?/?>

<p>When you are using this inside Models it becomes extremely powerful tool:</p>

<?Code?>
// inside Model_PaidBonus

class Model_PaidBonuss extends Model_Bonus {
    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $this->addCondition('is_paid',true);
    }
    function getBonus($employee_id){
        $q=$this->dsql();
        return $q
            ->field($q->expr('sum(salary)'))
            ->where('id',$employee_id)
            ;
    }
}
<?/?>

<p>Not only the function becomes universal for individual requests or can be used as sub-query, it also relies on SQL produced by model which would include the right condition to filter by a boolean field is_paid.</p>

<p>DSQL is irreplaceable when used as a glue between model selects and can be extensively used to increase your database query performance without loosing flexibility of your business level framework.</p>
