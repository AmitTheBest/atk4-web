<h1>Registering Methods in Application</h1>
<p>Application relies on "Controllers" to delegate most of it's functionality. For example, $api->locate() method uses PathFinder->locate() to get the actual results. The proxy method is defined in ApiCLI because it's an often-used one, however sometimes you need to create Application Controller which is used only rarely, but it still needs to be accessible through the $api.</p>

<p>Let's look at how you might want to create controller "System" which would define some of your system-wide logic. We would also want this controller to add few methods into the API class.</p>

<div class="g-row" id="doc-ref">
	<div class="g-6">
<?Code?>
class Controller_System extends AbstractController {
    function init(){
        parent::init();

        // register ourselves with API
        $this->api->system=$this;

        // add short-cut functions
        $this->api->addMethod('getUser',
            array($this,'getUser'));
    }
    function getUser(){
        $user=$this->add('Model_User')
            ->loadData($this->api->auth->get('id'));
        if(!$user->isInstanceLoaded()){
            $this->api->redirect('login');
        }

        return $user;
    }
}

        <h4>What happens?</h4>
        <p>This example registers two ways how you can access the "System" controller. First from anywhere you can use $this->api->system. Secondly, new method is added into API which you can execute as $this->api->getUser();</p>

        <h4>Legacy support</h4>
        <p>Another great use for registered methods is legacy support. Throughout system refactoring some methods may cease to exist. However to handle compatibility a controller may register a method for backwards compatibility. Agile Toolkit comes with Controller_Compat which register few things needed for compatibility and you can use a similar technique inside your application</p>

        <h4>System-wide methods</h4>
        <p>Using addGlobalMethod() you can add method to <b>all</b> the objects of Agile Toolkit. The syntax is same and the first argument of the function will be reference to the object. See file atk4/Controller/Compat.php for more information.</p>
