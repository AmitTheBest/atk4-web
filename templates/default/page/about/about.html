<p>Agile Toolkit is a powerful web development framework inspired by GUI Toolkits such as QT, Cocoa, .NET but implemented from scratch for rapid development of Web Applications in PHP. The three major advantages in using Agile Toolkit for your next Web Applications are:<ul>
	<li>Your User Interface will look consistent, themeable and cleaner</li>
	<li>Working with RDBMS (SQL) is much more efficient. Longer SQL queries but less total queries.</li>
	<li>Integration with jQuery is taken to a next level. Much more integrated.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>What is core philosophy of Agile Toolkit?</h3>
<p>Let me look at example. "Form" is implemented in many frameworks: Symfony, Code Igniter, CakePHP, Django, Ruby on Rails etc. However to add a form in your application within those frameworks you need to supply template, handling code, JavaScript code. In Agile Toolkit, class "Form" integrates with the JavaScript and Templates already and you don't need to worry about anything. This is all of the code you need to create form in Agile Toolkit:</p>

<?Example?>Form in Agile Toolkit
$form = $page->add('Form');
$form->addField('line','your_name');
$form->addField('text','your_message');
$form->addSubmit('Send');

if($form->isSubmitted()){
	$form->js()->univ()
		->dialogOK('Sent','Message sent, '.
			$form->get('your_name'))->execute();
}
<?/?>

<p>Agile Toolkit is about abstraction. It has templates. It has queries. It has models, but they are being cleverly abstracted and can only be used when necessary. As a result, Agile Toolkit introduces a new, much smarter approach to web development.</p>

<h3>How Agile Toolkit compares in terms of features?</h3>

<img class="float-right" style="padding-left: 1em" src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/agile-toolkit-structure.png<?/?>"/>

<p>There are two major parts to Agile Toolkit. It's the "Framework" and a "Toolkit". The Framework is defined from abstract classes and defines the back-bone of your application. Toolkit is a colection of classes ready-to-use in your application.</p>

<p>Both are seamlessly integrated and aim to create unique experience for a web developer. Agile Toolkit allows developers to use more features with less experience while being more focused on the short-term tasks.</p>

<h4>Period 1 - planning and prototyping (week 0)</h4>
<iframe class="float-right" style="padding-left: 1em" width="280" height="158" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LQYAeYS1RT8?list=PL7CBF92AB03A1CA3B&amp;hl=en_GB" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Agile Toolkit takes less than a day to create a data-model, admin backend and a prototype even for a large and complex projects. It folows principle of "works out of the box" and the initial speed-up is really impressive.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Agile Toolkit yet, you will need to spend quite some time learning. Agile Toolkit is not similar to other frameworks, and you will need to grasp new concepts, fundamental principles and it might slow you down. Still you will be able to produce your prototype faster than if you would develop from scratch or if you would used other framework.</p>

<h4>Period 2 - building fully-functional alpha (week 1-3)</h4>

<p>Agile Toolkit continue to stay most-efficient way to develop as you add new functionality. Full object-oriented approach, neat organization of your code quickly exceeds the progress of developers who used a CMS for putting prototype together.</p>

<p>The major benefit of Agile Toolkit is a clean and short syntax and a close integration between components.</p>

<h4>Period 3 - tweaking user experience (week 4-7)</h4>

<p>Third party frameworks are often driven by templates and the functionality is slowly populated into the hundreds of HTML pages. Agile Toolkit starts with reusable templates which can be further customized and diversified while developing. During this period Agile Toolkit still holds its ground against 3rd party frameworks.</p>

<h4>Period 4 - Support (week 8 onward)</h4>
<p>As you can clearly see on the graph, software built on a solid foundation continues to be highly maintainable throughout it's support cycle, while CMS, development from scratch and "your own CMS" is likely to be more of a problem when you need to demonstrate long-term stability, flexibility and extensibility.</p>

<h2>Benefits of using Agile Toolkit</h2>

<p>Apart from development efficiency there are many other benefits in using Agile Toolkit in your personal and commercial projects:</p>

              <h3>Web Development â€“ Reinvented</h3>
              <p>We have reinvented web development, so that you wouldn't need to. Agile Toolkit development is more simple than conventional PHP development or developing using mainstream Frameworks.</p>

              <p>Knowing HTML is no longer a requirement. Knowing JavaScript wouldn't stop you from using comprehensive AJAX. And without CSS knowledge, you can still create kick-ass CSS layouts.</p>

              <p>If you happen to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you will find a well-designed abstraction system at your fingertips with no limitations.</p>

            </div>


            <div class="features-text molecule " style="display: none">
              <h3>Add-on ecosystem</h3>
<p>Add-ons written for Agile Toolkit similar to "libraries" or "gems" but come with much smaller code-print. Your team can develop number of their own in-house addons which can be standardized in your company's development practices. Those add-ons can change any aspect of Agile Toolkit from new UI controls to new page routing or security-related controllers.</p>

<p>Often you will find add-ons written by other developers very suitable for your needs. It's a standard practice to extend 3rd party add-ons in your own classes. It results in unheard flexibility and ability for you to upgrade base code without loosing any of your own changes.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit has compatibility mode which can permit parts of Agile Toolkit work in compatible way to another version. For example, version 4.2 can be run in maximum syntax compatibility with 4.1.4. This means you can easily switch between major branches without the need to adjust your code.</p>

            <div class="features-text trophy " style="display: none">
              <h3>Speed and Scalability</h3>
              <p>When the information amount begins to grow it's a highest importance to be able to use efficient queries and minimize number of queries per page. Agile Toolkit has a powerful abilities to extend existing queries by adding additional expressions which are much more efficient than processing data on item-by-item basis.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit supports simultaneous requests for the multiple queries which will be required for page rendering and then collecting information in parallel. This mechanism works well with SQL data sources, your internal APIs or no-SQL drivers.</p>

<p>The code-base of Agile Toolkit and core add-ons is maintained by a very experienced system architects and developers. We understand that unnecessary features add more processing time and strive to achieve balance between flexible feature set and fast execution times.</p>

            <div class="features-text community " style="display: none">
              <h3>Community</h3>
              <p>Since Agile Toolkit was released in early 2011, it's community have been growing. With many professionals and corporate users Agile Toolkit is used in many private projects, enterprise applications.
              </p>

              <p>Join our "Google Group / Forum", find us on "Stack Overflow" and every Wednesday we hold a free one hour Google Hangout, where you can watch how practical application of Agile Toolkit helps us implement our on-line project.</p>

              <p>Because of our license sales, we are able to sustain support costs, and you will not find un-answered question about Agile Toolkit.</p>

              <h3>Commercial Add-ons</h3>
              <p>Agile Toolkit is Commercial Open-Source Product. Similarly it encourages developers to decide if they want to use an open-source platform or a commercial platform.</p>

              <p>The same approach is taken with many add-ons. They are either released under open-source license or are distributed commercially. Many companies, who are licensees of Agile Toolkit have in-house add-on collection and they maintain them.</p>

              <p>If you are looking to start an open-source project, create a new add-on for Agile Toolkit. You can dual-license it and also earn some money.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="features-text core" style="display: none">
              <h3>Beautiful Inside</h3>
<p>Agile Toolkit is designed for your team to dig into, analyze and replace it's components and properly use the right parent for your classes. If you are un-happy with implementation of "Form" class, you can replace it with your own implementation modification. More importantly is that 3rd party code will now use your modified version of the "Form" class.</p>

<p>Smart class structure makes high-level component implementation really awesome. Standard CRUD component (Create, Read, Update, Delete) takes approximately 100 lines in Agile Toolkit, is easy to understand and write alternative CRUD which suits your taste and UI requirements.</p>

            <div class="features-text gpl" style="display: none">
              <h3>Take and Share Licensing</h3>
              <p>We truly love Open-Source and you can download full-featured version of Agile Toolkit at no
              cost. We believe in Open-Source movement and are willing to promote it. If you have got Agile
              Toolkit for free, publish your software under free license.</p>

              <p>If protecting your Intellectual Property and Source Code is important for you, we offer you a
              license for use of Agile Toolkit in commercial environment. This license if focused on your
              commercial needs and is designed for businesses.</p>

              <p>If you work for non-profit, education or building a personal software - consider open sourcing your project from the day one. If you are a start-up or development team evaluating Agile Toolkit, you don't need a commercial license while developing project privately, but when it's time to go Live, buy the license which suits.

              <h3>Developer Training and Team Growth</h3>

              <p>Your decision in choosing a framework is a critical one. How long will it take to train developers? Will it be possible to find developer knowing the framework? Will maintenance and support of long-lived project cause problems in the future?</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit offers a great learning experience which is based on design goals and principles at the foundation of the framework. A skilled developer with experience with Object-Oriented development will grasp the principles quickly and will be able to read and fully understand the code written by any other developer on Agile Toolkit.</p>

<p>The amount of learning material is quickly growing and so does our developer base. Agile Toolkit is new and unique framework which is not based on any other popular framework. Regardless, many great developers who know Desktop development, iOS or development in Java will quickly grasp the fundamental principles and will be able to produce high-quality code.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="features-text re-use" style="display: none">
            	<H3>Stability and Testing</H3>
<p>Agile projects in particular are vulnerable to badly structured code. Unfortunately most of PHP frameworks do not define any coding style for user interface and it results in a non-standard and non-universal solutions. If your company plans to use agile approach properly, they will require to be able to change fundamental parts of your system, such as existing database fields, relations and algorithms easily. Model implementation in Agile Toolkit allows to do that or even convert your back-end from SQL to no-SQL without any modification to the User Interface.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit has one of the most stable ways of building AJAX applications. Your application may be running a complex client-side scripting logic yet you will be able to extend it easily without having a separate team allocated to build a rich client.</p>

              <h3>Don't have a team? Pick our team!</h3>
              <p>Why not select a seasoned team of professional to develop your project for you?</p>

              <p>Agile Toolkit has a coding convention which ensures that the code 3rd party deliver meets the best coding practice standards. If you plan to consolidate your development by moving in-house you will be pleased to see that the code-base is well-developed and is not taking away any of your future flexibility.</p>

              <p>Unlike other frameworks, maintaining Agile Toolkit is easier and more cost-efficient than projects not using Agile Toolkit.</p>

            <div class="features-text book" style="display: none">
              <h3>Develop Smarter</h3>
<p>Architecture of Agile Toolkit has a highest development efficiency amongst all web development frameworks without sacrifice in flexibility or speed. Coding style with Agile Toolkit prompts developers to improve their analytical and structuring abilities. The code is highly maintainable â€” code written by one of your developer can easily be maintained by other developer familiar with Agile Toolkit</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit has flexible API system which allows you to integrate it as much as you require. If you run a legacy system and require compatibility, you can migrate the interface while keeping your back-end API structure. You may also develop a business model structure along with administrative system and use models in any other framework of your choice.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit permits your project manager to separate tasks between different developers and allow them to seamlessly integrate code. Developer does not require constant availability of designer and vice versa to make a good looking, interactive website. Each developer is encouraged to write their API documentation which can be used by other developers on an object level.</p>

<h3>Mini FAQ</h3>

<div class="atk-layout c2">
<div>

<?MoreInfo?>Is it a new framework?
<p>Agile Toolkit was known previously as AModules and traces it's history to 1999. Each major release have been a major rewrite, although some of the code was just cleaned up and ported. Throughout it's history the toolkit have powered over 300 commercial projects. In 2010 it was decided to release Agile Toolkit publicly under open-source and commercial licenses</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit uses many of the concepts found in other frameworks, although they are implemented independently, often differently. Some features pre-dates appearance of their analogues in other frameworks. See how Agile Toolkit has evolved on <a href="/about/history.html">Agile Toolkit Timeline</a></p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>How long it will take to learn Agile Toolkit?
<p>Typically Agile Toolkit takes few weeks to fully learn it. Many concepts of Agile Toolkit go pretty deep and you don't need to know them when you start.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit is based on a set of concepts which you also need to understand and use when you develop your software in the future. We've found that some of the more experienced developers feel outside of their comfort zone with Agile Toolkit. Well, there are still need for COBOL developers.</p>

<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>Why is it called Agile?
<p>
Agile Toolkit is perfect when it comes to Web Development using Agile Approach. Some of the principles behind Agile Methodology are also principles behind design of Agile Toolkit such as:
<ul>
<li>Getting first version done quickly. Agile Toolkit comes with objects which work with minimum configuration. Your first prototype is few days away.</li>
<li>Ability to see work in progress, demonstrate it to client for feedback. With powerful web UI maintained by Agile Toolkit you have a solid foundation to build upon. Maintaining a healthy UI from the start gives ability to demonstrate progress of all developers.</li>
<li>Use most efficient way of development. Agile Toolkit supports a lot of ways to enhance your software, but they are all optional. If you need to deliver software quickly, no environment beats Agile Toolkit.</li>
<li>If your working in teams, nothing is more frustrating than waiting for Design team to finish mock-ups or Backend team to re-implement a feature. Agile Toolkit allows JavaScript developer, UI developer, Designer and Back-end developer to work independently and then join their work together.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<?/?>
</div>
<div>
<?MoreInfo?>I never made Web Application, will I understand it?
<p>Yes. The core concept of Agile Toolkit is really simple. We have shown project code to people who have no development experience and they admit it's very clear and self-explanatory. </p>

<p>To start with Agile Toolkit you will need to go through Introduction and Tutorial. Afterwards you can simply mash-up your application from blocks.</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>I am hardcore developer / hacker. Will it restrict me?
<p>No. Agile Toolkit is based on several powerful concepts (such as abstraction) often used by senior developers. Agile Toolkit attempts to be very elegant and achieve a lot of functionality through a small amount of "clever" code.</p>

<p>As a power user, you will be able to take advantage of re-usability and customization to avoid any restrictions.</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>Can I make website with ATK? Is it a CMS?
<p>Yes. You need to know very little from PHP to use Agile Toolkit. Agile Toolkit is well suited for CMS-based sites with custom logic and interactive behavior.</p>

<p>Our <a target="_blank" href="http://agiletech.ie/">website for Agile Technologies</a> similarly uses Agile Toolkit, but there the content is stored in MySQL database and is editable on-line, which makes it a proper CMS system.</p>

<p>Unless you want to make a quick website for your client within 1 day time, Agile Toolkit will give you much greater flexibility and control over content, dynamic interaction and web2.0 of your website.

<h2>Why another PHP framework?</h2>
<p>Agile Toolkit pre-dates most of other frameworks (except PEAR and HORDE perhaps), but because of it's closed-source nature it was re-structured 3 times. It allowed us to re-think the approach and arrive to where we are today. In our opinion Agile Toolkit approach is several years ahead of the PHP industry.</p>

<h3>What problems Agile Toolkit Addresses?</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Inclusion of GOOD LOOKING user interface usable by developers out of the box.</li>
	<li>Full use of Object-Oriented principles for Models, Pages, Controllers, Applications and Views.</li>
	<li>Suitability for Agile Development and Enterprise. Allowing to extend projects without breaking code which works.</li>
	<li>Create a framework with simple syntax.</li>
	<li>Keep things independent and portable. Avoid globals, static and constants.</li>
	<li>Avoid adding meaningless wrappers. Do not complicate the code. Keep everything short.</li>
	<li>Be very extensive. Extending classes. Extending objects. Dynamic methods. Hooks. Substituting core classes.</li>
	<li>Propose a philosophy and base development around it. Apply same approach on add-ons and your code.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Is Agile Toolkit a most suitable framework for my unique needs?</h2>

<p>Yes</p>
