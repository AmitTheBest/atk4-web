<h1>Best Practices and Miscellaneous Information</h1>

<h2>Keeping Your Functionality Scalable</h2>
<p>Scalability is the ability to grow without facing hindering limitations. When the functionality of the application
increases or changes, a poorly planned and maintained project will encounter stability problem and loss of development
efficiency.</p>

<p>The two major cures against the curse of "spaghetti code" are a decent framework and refactoring. Most of refactoring in
Agile Toolkit is moving code into a standalone view.</p>

<h3>Prevent your API class from growing too big</h3>
<p>In mature web software the API class reaches around 1000 lines of code, and contains application-related logic.
Having page definitions in the same file makes it increasingly difficult to work with it. It's suggested that from the start
you should use a class-based approach to define pages in your software.</p>

<h3>Extend page classes</h3>
<p>If you have had proper training in Object-Oriented development, you should know that making similar pages inherit
from a common parent might save you some time. For instance, you may have 2 preference pages for 2 different types of users, but
the structure and objects on those pages might be similar enough to share them through OOP.</p>
<p>In this case, create a lib/Page/Preferences.php parent class, then extend it twice, customising the child classes as you 
find appropriate. Because the class is inside "lib" and not "page" it won't be accessible directly through a URL.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can put the parent class into page/preferences.php and define it as "abstract". Between those two
approaches, the first one is recommended, because the "not found" case will be properly handled.</p>
<p>Another use for this is to define pages with some properties such as having local menu or being part of a wizard.</p>

<h2>Upper and Lower Cases</h2>
<p>If you are developing on Windows or Mac, you use a case-insensitive operating system. However, always assume that
your deployment platform will be case-sensitive. Page classes always start with "page" and follow this pattern:
"page_user_preferences_twitter" where underscores correspond with their directory structure. When placed inside "lib",
classes use CamelCase such as "Page_FileManager", however here they can use underscores to define areas or zones as well as
inheritance, eg: "Page_User_Settings".</p>

<h2>Use of Slashes Versus Underscores</h2>
<p>If you have a page_user_preferences_twitter page class, it can be accessed as either 'user_preferences_twitter' or
'user/preferences/twitter'. Link building will work properly regardless of which you use, however if you are
using slashes with mod_rewrite and your own template, you may encounter issues with relative image/css paths. Proper
use of &lt;?template?&gt; tags inside your templates will help you avoid this problem.
