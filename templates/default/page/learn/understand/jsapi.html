        <p>Agile Toolkit contains number of JavaScript libraries, jQuery plugins and jQuery UI widgets to transparently enhance your web application usability.</p>

        <h3>How does that work?</h3>
        <p>When you add a "Form" to page with the following code:</p>
<?Code?>
$page->add('Form');
<?/?>
        <p>the form initializes ui.atk4_form.js widget which enhances the way how form works, reports errors and submit results to the back-end. It works very intuitive and straightforward, but there are bunch of ways how you enhance and extend default functionality.</p>
