        <h1>Execution of The API Class</h1>
        <h3>Initializing Auth and checking Auth</h3>
        <p>While you can also execute auth->check() inside init(), we recommend performing auth-check inside an initLayout()
        function:</p>
<?Code?>
    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $this->add('BasicAuth')->allow('john','secret');
    }
    function initLayout(){
        $this->auth->check();
        parent::initLayout();

        // Replace "login" link region with logout/user info
        if($this->auth->isLoggedIn()){
            $this->add('View',null,'UserMenu','view/usermenu/loggedin')
                ->set($this->auth->get()));
        }
    }
<?/?>
        <p>Did you notice that the call to auth->check() is done before calling parent::initLayout()? That's because we do not
        want any pages to be initialized before authentication is done.</p>

        <h3>Form Submission</h3>
        <p>Form submission is normally handled after all other views are initialized. When form is submitted, the rendering
        phase is skipped also. Submission occurs only if a form with a proper ID has been found.</p>


        <h3>Rendering</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit provides support for partial rendering of views based on 3 criteria: cut_page - outputs only page's
        content, cut_object - outputs content of a certain object and cut_region - outputs content of a certain region. This is
        explained in more depth later</p>

        <h3>Interrupting initialization phase</h3>
        <p>It is possible to interrupt execution of the init() phase. This might be necessary if you wish to avoid any more
        objects being added to some view. To terminate execution of init:</p>
<?Code?>
// from inside View

// if product is not selected:

if(!$product){
    $this->add('ProductSelector');
    throw $this->exception('Stop showing page until product is selected','StopInit');
        // throws Exception_StopInit
}
<?/?>
        <p>This approach should be used only if calling "return" is not sufficient - that is: from either a view which has been
        placed inside page, or if your page extends another, common abstract page.</p>
