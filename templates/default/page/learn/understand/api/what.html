        <h3>Controllers versus Singletons</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit does not use singletons. Singletons do not provide any performance or persistence benefits in
        PHP5.2 or higher. Instead, Agile Toolkit has the concept of "Controllers". A controller can be added into an object, but a
        controller of a certain type can only be added to a certain object once. This is a "soft" restriction: you can still add second 
        controller of same type to the same object at your own risk, if you specify a different name for it.</p>

        <p>For example: you can add a "Logger" controller into the API, which enhances the way errors are displayed. Adding another Logger
        into the API again will do nothing, and will simply return a reference to your existing Logger.</p>

        <p>Because it's possible to have multiple APIs at the same time, this opens up new strategies for testing. For
        instance, a 'testing' API can initialize your 'real' API. Before executing a test, the 'test' API can destroy() some of the
        controllers in the 'real' API, and replace them with new ones. This implements a dependency-injection based testing framework, which
        is really close to the real-life environment of your application.</p>
