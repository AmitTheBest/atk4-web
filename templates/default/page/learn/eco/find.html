        <h1>Look for help from Community</h1>
        <p>Community of Agile Toolkit developers is very young and growing. However our community is focused on benefit and
        making web developmet more affordable and more accessible. If you are new, look for projects using Agile Toolkit or
        addons contributed by other developers.</p>


        <h3>Where to find demos and examples?</h3>
        <p>Many examples will appear on documentation and introduction pages.
        Additionally you can find examples on <a href="http://demo.atk4.com/demo.html">demo.atk4.com</a>.
        Another location for examples is <a href="<?page?>example/list<?/page?>">Examples page on agiletoolkit.org</a>.</p>

        <h3>Where to find web projects based on Agile Toolkit</h3>
        <p>As more open-source projects are being created with Agile Toolkit we are readying our community portal which will
        help us share projects specifically built in Agile Toolkit. Given a common platform, it's easier to maintain and
        contribute community-driven projects this way.</p>

        <p>We have invested some time into Colubris project - Budget Tracking system: <a
        href="https://github.com/agiletech/colubris">https://github.com/agiletech/colubris</a> and expecting other developers
        to announce their projects.</p>


        <h3>Codepad</h3>
        <p>There is a codepad.agiletoolkit.org which is used by the core team to link to some samples exactly. Codepad is
        available from Git and you can install it on your own server and share links with others.</p>
        <p>Sample codepad page looks like this:
        <a href="http://codepad.agiletoolkit.org/issue12?b=devel">http://codepad.agiletoolkit.org/issue12?b=devel</a>. If you
        omit "?b=devel" option, 4.0 version of Agile Toolkit will be used instead of 4.1.</p>

        <h3>Ask for demos</h3>
        <p>If you have any idea for a demo, please ask for it on Twitter or through Contact form.</p>
