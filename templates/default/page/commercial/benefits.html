<h3 class="w-big-icon"><i class="big-icon icon-book"></i><em>Develop Smarter</em></h3>
<p>Architecture of Agile Toolkit has a highest development efficiency amongst all web development frameworks without sacrifice in flexibility or speed. Coding style with Agile Toolkit prompts developers to improve their analytical and structuring abilities. The code is highly maintainable â€” code written by one of your developer can easily be maintained by other developer familiar with Agile Toolkit</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit has flexible API system which allows you to integrate it as much as you require. If you run a legacy system and require compatibility, you can migrate the interface while keeping your back-end API structure. You may also develop a business model structure along with administrative system and use models in any other framework of your choice.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit permits your manager to separate tasks between different developers and allow them to seamlessly integrate code. Developer does not require constant availability of designer and vice versa to make a good looking, interactive website. Each developer is encouraged to write their API documentation which can be used by other developers on an object level.</p>


<h3 class="w-big-icon"><i class="big-icon icon-trophy"></i><em>Speed and Scalability</em></h3>
<p>When the information amount begins to grow it's a highest importance to be able to use efficient queries and minimize number of queries per page. Agile Toolkit has a powerful abilities to extend existing queries by adding additional expressions which are much more efficient than processing data on item-by-item basis.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit supports simultaneous requests for the multiple queries which will be required for page rendering and then collecting information in parallel. This mechanism works well with SQL data sources, your internal APIs or no-SQL drivers.</p>

<p>The code-base of Agile Toolkit is maintained by a very experienced system architects and developers. We understand that unnecessary features add more processing time and strive to achieve balance between flexible feature set and fast execution times.</p>

<h3 class="w-big-icon"><i class="big-icon icon-re-use"></i><em>Developer training and running costs</em></h3>
<p>Your decision in in using framework is a critical one. How long will it take to train developers? Will it be possible to find developer knowing the framework? Will maintenance and support of long-lived project cause problems in the future?</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit offers a great learning experience which is based on design goals and principles at the foundation of the framework. A skilled developer with experience with Object-Oriented development will grasp the principles quickly and will be able to read and fully understand the code written by any other developer on Agile Toolkit.</p>

<p>The amount of learning material is quickly growing and so does our developer base. Agile Toolkit is new and unique framework which is not based on any other popular framework. Regardless, many great developers who know Desktop development, iOS or development in Java will quickly grasp the fundamental principles and will be able to produce high-quality code.</p>

<h3 class="w-big-icon"><i class="big-icon icon-cubes"></i><em>Stability and Testing</em></h3>
<p>Agile projects in particular are vulnerable to badly structured code. Unfortunately most of PHP frameworks do not define any coding style for user interface and it results in a non-standard and non-universal solutions. If your company plans to use agile approach properly, they will require to be able to change fundamental parts of your system, such as existing database fields, relations and algorithms easily. Model implementation in Agile Toolkit allows to do that or even convert your back-end from SQL to no-SQL without any modification to the User Interface.

<p>Agile Toolkit has one of the most stable ways of building AJAX applications. Your application may be running a complex client-side scripting logic yet you will be able to extend it easily without having a separate team allocated to build a rich client.</p>

<h3 class="w-big-icon"><i class="big-icon icon-tree"></i><em>Start Slowly</em></h3>
<p>We highly advise you to test Agile Toolkit on a small project within your company. You can allocate a single developer to exploring the power of the toolkit and even on his own he will produce results faster than some of your other teams. That it because Agile Toolkit comes with many things ready to use such as User Interface, CSS framework, JavaScript framework.</p>

<p>Our team can help you out with your first project or even develop a smaller project for you on a contract basis. If you are happy with results we will proceed with the training of your team and supporting your unique needs in web development.</p>

<p>You may also rely on the Agile Toolkit Development community. The community is built from task-focused highly skilled professionals who can appreciate elegance of Agile Toolkit, but if you post a question through stackoverflow.com, it will be answered on same or next day.

<h3 class="w-big-icon"><i class="big-icon icon-molecule"></i><em>Add-on ecosystem</em></h3>
<p>Add-ons written for Agile Toolkit similar to "libraries" or "gems" but come with much smaller code-print. Your team can develop number of their own in-house addons which can be standardized in your company's development practices. Those add-ons can change any aspect of Agile Toolkit from new UI controls to new page routing or security-related controllers.</p>

<p>Often you will find add-ons written by other developers very suitable for your needs. It's a standard practice to extend 3rd party add-ons in your own classes. It results in unheard flexibility and ability for you to upgrade base code without loosing any of your own changes.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit has compatibility mode which can permit parts of Agile Toolkit work in compatible way to another version. For example, version 4.2 can be run in maximum syntax compatibility with 4.1.4. This means you can easily switch between major branches without the need to adjust your code.</p>

<h3 class="w-big-icon"><i class="big-icon icon-core"></i><em>Beautiful inside</em></h3>
<p>Agile Toolkit is designed for your team to dig into, analyze and replace it's components and properly use the right parent for your classes. If you are un-happy with implementation of "Form" class, you can replace it with your own implementation modification. More importantly is that 3rd party code will now use your modified version of the "Form" class.</p>

<p>Smart class structure makes high-level component implementation really awesome. Standard CRUD component (Create, Read, Update, Delete) takes approximately 100 lines in Agile Toolkit, is easy to understand and write alternative CRUD which suits your taste and UI requirements.</p>
