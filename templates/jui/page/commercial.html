<p>In the world of today, web is the most popular medium for software deployment. Many developers have learned new languages for developing web applications such as PHP, Java, Ruby, Python etc.</p>

<p>Language itself is not sufficient to build a good web application so there are a choice of Libraries and Frameworks wich help developers to deal with their tasks.</p>
