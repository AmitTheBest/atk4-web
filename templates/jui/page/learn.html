        <p>Documentation for Agile Toolkit is organized into a tree-like structure for better navigation. There are 3 main
        sections of documentation: Introduction, Learning and Reference. You can always see where you are by looking at
        the bread-crumb bar on the top of any documentation page. For example, now you are in the "Learning" section</p>

        <h3>Try as you go</h3>
