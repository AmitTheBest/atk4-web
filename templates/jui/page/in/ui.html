        <h3>Fully-functional professional UI</h3>
        <p>
        Cross-browser and pixel-perfect Web User Interface based on Web Standards such as Grid System and jQuery UI Framework
        are used by some high-end designers. Agile Toolkit includes all that and requires no effort from you to start usign
        it. All the UI is completely built in HTML and can function even without JavaScript support.
        </p>
        <p>
        Typography and many UI elements are bundled in Agile Toolkit making it a perfect platform for web software, website
        or community portal.

        <h3>Web Platform Development</h3>
        <p>
        Agile Toolkit is well suited for web platform development as well as Software as a Service applications. It includes
        ability to change CSS themes through Themeroller, add your own CSS or completely replace every bit of HTML produced.
        What's even more amazing is that you can only change what you need to change, Agile Toolkit automatically looks in
        several directories for that CSS file.
