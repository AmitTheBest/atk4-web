$form=$view->add('Form');
$form->addField('line','name');
$form->addSubmit('Greet');
if($form->isSubmitted()){
  $js=$form->js()->remove();
  $js=$view->js(null,$js)->text('Hello, '.$form->get('name'))->hide()->fadeIn();
  $form->js()->fadeOut('slow',$js->_enclose())->execute();
}

        <div style="float: right; border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 4px">
          <?Execute?>
          $page->add('Alex');
          <?/?>
          <center>"Alex" View Class</center>

    <h4>User Interface Consistency</h4>
    <div class="g-row">
      <div class="g-4">
        <p>If you have a long project ahead of you, you probably think that relying on Models/MVC/ORM principles will help your
        business logic become flexible. We extend this principle to the User Interface. Don't repeat yourself when writing markup
        for a button. Design your User Interface once and use it forewer.</p>
        </div> <div class="g-2">

        <?Execute?>
        $b=$page->add('Frame')->setTitle('Sample');
        $b->add('Icon')->set('fun-happy');
        $b->add('Text')->set('Text Label');
        <?/?>
        <br/>

        <?Execute?>
        // $page->add('Button')->set('Continue Â»')->setStyle('float','right');
        <?/?>
        <a style="float: right" href="<?page?>intro<?/?>">Learn More...</a>
