        <h3>Introducing Models</h3>
        <p>
        Model implementation in Agile Toolkit gives you a great opportunity to bind Views to a business entity. Models,
        implemented as pure PHP classes, define properties, behaviour, relations and conditions of a business entity. Once
        defined they can be inherited and used inside any View - Form, Grid, Lister, Auth and so on.

        <h3>View-level integration</h3>
        <p>
        Instead of associating each page with model, Agile Toolkit associates it on a View level. That means you can have
        multiple elements on your page associated with different models working seamlessly.

        <p>Form below actually adds employees to the database:</p>
    </div>
</div>
<?Example?>
$form=$page->add('MVCForm');
$form->setModel('Employee',array('name','salary'));
if($form->isSubmitted()){
	$form->update();
	$form->js()->univ()
		->successMessage('Employee added')
		->execute();
}
