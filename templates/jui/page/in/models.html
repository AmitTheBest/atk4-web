    <p>Today you may come across many curious hobbyist frameworks but many do not deserve to power your next big 
    web project. Agile Toolkit is ready for Corporations and Businesses which have very strict expectations</p>

    <h4>Performance and Scalability</h4>
    <p>Frameworks introduce overheads. Caching is often the wrong solution. Agile Toolkit focuses at improving
    scalability of your application while keeping code clean and lightweight.</p>
   
    <p>Agile Toolkit allows you to build extremely complex UI with minimum queries per page. Caching is no longer
    a necessity. Your code will be as you would have an SQL expert design all your database queries for you. And
    yet developers are not exposed to the dangers of raw SQL.</p>

    <h4>Prototype, that scaled</h4>
    <p>Often the code which used to put together a quick prototype software can't be used for a full-featured,
    commercial purposes. Agile Toolkit makes it possible. With Agile Toolkit you can develop quickly when
    you need results quickly. You can polish your application when your budget and time permits.</p>

    <h4>Security from Human Error</h4>
    <p>Developers make mistakes. For many web projects simple developers mistake became source of
    major corporate crisis.</p>

    <p>It is in our nature to make mistakes. That's why Agile Toolkit has precautions. Your Web
    Software will consist of Business and Presentation logic. Business logic relies on Object-Oriented
    Models which introduce physical boundaries for the presentation logic.</p>

    <p>For example, if "Order" model has a built-in condition preventing it from loading records
    owned by other users, not a single Widget or UI element will be able to access, change or
    delete restricted records.</p>

    <h4>Stability</h4>
    <p>We know two things too well: 1) changing your code introduces bugs. 2) you will have to change your code.</p>
    <p> With Agile Toolkit you have
    much less chance to unintentionally break your application. You can now safely follow principles of Extreme 
    Programming or other Agile Methodology.</p>
