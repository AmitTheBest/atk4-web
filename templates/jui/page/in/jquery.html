        <h3>jQuery (UI) back-bone</h3>
        <p>
        Pick almost any jQuery Add-on, save it into local directory and with single line of code you can get this working.
        Below is the demo of a masked-input. What's even cooler is that addon was loaded dynamically when you first opened
        this pop-up.
        </p>
        <p>
        Agile Toolkit takes advantage of jQuery UI widget factory and provides a lot of extensions. For example, if you type
        anything into the field then attempt to close this frame, you will get un-saved data warning.

        <h3>jQuery chains and libraries</h3>
        <p>
        Agile Toolkit provides integration of jQuery on object level. When method "js" is called on any view, right from PHP
        you can define behaviours and make different PHP objects interact in the browser.
        </p>
        
        <p>This is a handy approach, but it's limited. If you are comfortable with JavaScript you can add functions
        into the "univ" class such as "demoFunction()" below. You can also write your own jQuery plugins or widgets for more
        complex behaviour, Agile Toolkit will take care of dynamic loading and anything else.</p>

    ->_load('jquery.maskedinput-1.3.min')
