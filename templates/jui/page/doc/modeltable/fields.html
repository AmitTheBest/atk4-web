<h1>Field types and User Interface Integration</h1>
<p>When the model is being described, method "addField()" is called. This method adds instance of a 'Field' class into model and returns it. The Field then is used to store field-related information and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Setting Field Properties</h2>
<p>Field object has methods to manipulate it's properties in a chain-able way. In the next example caption(), type() and defaultValue() methods are called which set respective properties to supplied values</p>

<?Code?>
$model->addField('age')
	->type('int')
	->caption('Person\'s age')
	->defaultValue(18);
<?/?>

<p>Field object participates in constructing queries and also building UI widgets. Model will only address a field of a table if respective field has been defined. Calling below methods will change the properties. Calling same methods without any arguments will return the current property value.</p>

<p>Additional properties may be created in the future. You can also add your own properties by extending 'Field' class:</p>

<?Code?>
class MyField extends Field {
	public $hint=null;
	function hint($t=undefined){ return $this->setterGetter('hint', $t);}
}
class MyModelTable extends Model_Table {
	public $field_class='MyField';
}
<?/?>

<p>You can also use default model with your own custom field type like this:</p>

<?Code?>
class Book extends Model_Table {
	function init(){
		parent::init();

		$this->add('MyField','field_name')->caption('My Custom Field Object');
	}
}
<?/?>


<h3>Field Types</h3>
<p>The "type" property changes the way how field property is being displayed and also stored. For example type('boolean') will allow you to set "true" and "false" values to the field but will use 0 and 1 when saved into MySQL. type('money') will impact display of the field primarily. When a grid with 'money' column is displayed, this column will be formatted as money and will be colored red if negative.</p>

<p>Type of the field is recognized by view controller which is used to populate the UI element</p>

<h2>UI Controllers</h2>
<p>On it's own, Form does not know how to operate with the model. Neither does Model know about existence of the Form or how to integrate with it. There must be a class to bind View and Model and that's "Controller". In case with Form the class is called Controller_MVCForm.</p>

<p>The View class defines property $default_controller='MVCForm'; Subsequently, when $view->setModel('Book') is called, the controller is initialized first and is used to bind model and view together.</p>

<p>You can also define $default_controller property in your model. So, model will use $default_controller when creating controller for the view.</p>

<p>Reference to controller can always be found in $view->controller. You can create multiple controllers, which will rewrite reference. This reference can be useful if you are willing to associate View with additional model or import more fields.</p>

<p>Two methods are called from the setModel() just after controller is set: controller->setActualFields($actual_fields) and controller->_bindView();</p>

<p>With Form and Grid, second argument to setModel() specifies list of Actual Fields. These fields will be automatically populated into Grid or Form from specified model.</p>

<h3>Importing more fields</h3>
<p>If you are willing to import more fields, you can use $view->controller->importField('age');</p>

<p>It is also possible to import fields from another model by calling $view->controller->importFields($other_model,array('field1','field2')); Here is an example how to create form with two fields</p>

<?Code?>
$form = $this->add('Form');
$form->addClass('atk-row');

$form->addSeparator('span6');	// left column
$form->setModel('User');		// Imports data from user. Model accessible through $form->model
$form->model->load($_GET['user_id']);	// load record to edit

$form->addSeparator('span6');   // right column
$form->controller->importFields(
	$form->model->ref('address_id')		// related record
);

$form->addSubmit();

if($form->isSubmitted()){
	$form->update()->js()->univ()->successMessage('Saved!')->execute();
}
<?/?>

<p>Above example initially associates form with one model ('User'), but then it traverses the reference ('address_id') to add field from the other model. When $form->update() is called, both models will be updated and saved. Additionally the fields imported from the second model will appear in the right column, separate from the main fields, although within the same form</p>

<p>By default form fields are named just like model fields but if different forms contain same field, this will be resolved by naming form field differently</p>
