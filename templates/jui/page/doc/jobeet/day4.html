<h1>Day 4: The Controller and the View</h1>
<p>
Yesterday, we explored how Agile Toolkit simplifies database management and connect it to your first CRUD. And by usign relationship you saw how dropdown values were automatically populated from the right table.

Today, we are going to customize the basic job module we created yesterday. The job module already has all the code we need for Jobeet:

A page to list all jobs
A page to create a new job
A page to update an existing job
A page to delete a job
Although the code is ready to be used as is, we will refactor the templates to match closer to the Jobeet mockups.
