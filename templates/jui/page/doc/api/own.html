<h1>Re-usable Application Classes</h1>
<p>You might be the type of developer, who likes when things are exactly how he wants. In this case you will find yourself carrying around some code snippets.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit finally gives you a great way to move things around without actually copy-pasting things. First, create your own repository or a shared directory,
  which you can include in all your projects. Let's say it's located along the "atk4" and "atk4-addons" in a folder called "my-stuff".</p>

<p>Inside your own directories you would have your own API base-class along with some libraries.</p>

<h4>my-stuff/MyApi.php</h4>
<?Code?>
class MyApi extends ApiFrontend {
    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $api->addLocation('my-stuff',array(
            'php'=>'lib',
            'js'=>'js',
            'templates'=>'templates'
            ))
        ->setParent($api->pathfinder->base_location);

        $this->add('Controller_MyUtils');
    }
}
<?/?>

<p>When you are starting new application you would additionally need to do the following:<ul>
<li>Copy or link "my-stuff" folder inside your new project</li>
<li>Manually include your application definition class inside index.php:
<?Code?>
include 'atk4/loader.php';
include 'my-stuff/MyApi.php';
$api=new Frontend();
$api->main();
<?/?>
<li>lib/Frontend should extend MyApi instead of ApiFrontend</li>
</ul></p>

<p>That's all you need to create a great way to re-use your code, templates or base models.</p>
