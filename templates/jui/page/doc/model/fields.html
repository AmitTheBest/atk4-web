<h1>Defining Field Meta-Information</h1>

<p>Once addField() is called the field will be listed as one of the model's elements. You can access existing field or even destroy it through $model->getElement('field'); Sometimes when you extend model, you would want to change certain attributes of a field.</p>

<div class="g-row" id="doc-ref">
  <div class="g-6">
<?Code?>
class Model_Admin extends Model_User {
  function init(){
    parent::init();

    $this->getField('is_admin')
      ->system(true)
      ->defaultValue(true);    

    $this->getField('email')
      ->destroy();

    $this->addField('privileges');
  }
}
<?/?>
  </div>
  <div class="g-6">
    <p>When you will be using Model_Admin now, field configuration will be different. Email field will be ignored, but a new field "privileges" will be used. Admin's model does not specify a different value for $table property, therefore same table is going to be used.</p>

    <p>Hierarchic models are even more useful when used with Model_Table's conditions.</p>

    <p>Calling destroy() on an object will remove it from it's owner's elements array. If model is not referenced in any other way, Garbage Collector will get rid of it.</p>
    <p>If you want for a model to represent only one specific record, you can load it's data by default, such as by calling load() inside init(). It will, however, not prevent model object from un-loading that record and loading other record. Calling load() without arguments will load first possible record.</p>
