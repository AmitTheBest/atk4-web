    <h4>Goals and Features of Model</h4>
    <?MoreInfo?>Eliminate the need to write any queries
    <p>Models will manage your SQL Query for you, consistently and reliably.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Automatic Conditions
    <p>When traversing references, conditions are automatically set eliminating the possibility for developer's mistake.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Complex Table Joins
    <p>Sometimes your business entity consists of 2, 3 or even more tables joined together. Relational Models support automatic table joins when you are retrieving data or inserts into related table and linking ID fields if you are addin records.</p> 
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Expressions
    <p>Models do eliminate need for the SQL but they still give the power of specifying expressions.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Based on Basic Models
    <p>Because Model_Table inherits regular Model, you can still use it with any Data Controllers such as caches.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Multi-row Acitons
    <p>Whenever you need to create a custom SQL query, you can clone it off "base" query used by the model. That will automatically apply conditions and joins.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Insert versus Modify
    <p>Relational Models distinguish events for performing Insert and Modification. You can set hooks to intercept and modify query before it is executed.</p>
    <?/?>

    <?MoreInfo?>Relies on DSQL
    <p>Through the power of DSQL Models support multiple database vendors and will automatically use proper SQL syntax.</p>
    <?/?>

    <h4>What DSQL is not?</h4>
    <p>In the spirit of Agile Toolkit â€” all of it's classes are strictly focused on a one simple task, without trying to do everything. Here are things which Model will not do and why:
    <?MoreInfo?>No attempting to manage structure
    <p>That is job of your database migration scripts.</p>
    <?/?>
    <?MoreInfo?>Not Limiting
    <p>Relational Model does not take the power of custom SQL queries.</p>
    <?/?>
