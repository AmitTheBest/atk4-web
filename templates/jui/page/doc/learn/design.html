<h1>Using Agile Toolkit without any PHP code knowledge</h1>
<p>
To those who have a very little knowledge of programming, there are already many things you CAN do with Agile Toolkit. In this guide I will be looking at Agile Toolkit as alternative of the CMS systems you might want to use, and when use of toolkit is actually better. This guide is also useful for designers who are developing design for some ATK4 projects.</p>
<p>You will learn:
<ul>
<li>how to download something that works right away.</li>
<li>how to create a very basic website. Templates.</li>
<li>difference between static and dynamic content.</li>
<li>how to use View classes or create your own.</li>
<li>about template skins.</li>
<li>difference between APIs. Automatically processed tags.</li>
<li>about integrating Addons. Using third party code.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You will need an Apache webserver with PHP installed.
</p>

<h2>How to download something that works right away</h2>
<div class="text-right30">
	<p>For your convenience you can grab a <a href="/download/WebsiteATK4.zip">WebsiteATK4.zip</a> from our download page</p>
</div>

<p>
Agile Toolkit is collection of tools. You start with empty website and add components when you need them. This concept ensures high speed of your site.
To help you get started, you should download a sample website, which will contain couple of pages. You can look through those pages, although this guide will be focusing on creating new pages.
</p>
<p>
Download and unpack WebsiteATK4.zip somewhere into your webroot. Once it's unpacked open this directory through the web browser. If you see directory structure, check that mod_rewrite is enabled.
</p>

<h2>How to create a very basic website. Templates.</h2>

<p>
Go straight into <u>templates/web</u> directory. This directory is a default location of your templates. Inside this directory you might find few standard directories such as <u>page</u>, <u>css</u>, <u>images</u>, <u>view</u> and also the file <i>shared.html</i>. This file, <i>shared.html</i> acts as a default header and footer of any other page on your website. Open this file in text editor of your choice.
</p>
<h3>shared.html</h3>
<p>
Inside this file you will find &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; definitions. Continue looking through it until you find the following text: &lt;?Content&gt;. This is the opening tag. Further below you shall find &lt;?/Content?&gt;, which is a closed tag. Those tags are recognized by the template management system of Agile Toolkit — <a href="/doc/DBlite">SMlite</a>. This template system designed to be extremely simple and very very fast. So the only thing which can be in the templates are those tags. There are few other formats for those tags, in particular &lt;?$some-tag?&gt; would be a self-closing tag, which is equivalent to an empty tag.
</p>
<h3>Adding more pages</h3>
<p>The basic logic of your website, is that it finds a template matching the one in the URL inside <u>page/</u> directory, then inserts its contents into &lt;?$Content?&gt; tag during request and sends a combination to the browser. <u>page/index.html</u> will be your default page, however you can create as many pages as you want. As soon as you create those new templates they will become available on your website.</p>

<?MoreInfo?>Why did we choose this tag format?
<p>
Tags such as &lt;anything&gt; are being ignored by browsers or HTML editors. Tags which use &lt;? or &lt;% are preserved by those editors, they believe they might contain some valuable code. You might be able to open <u>shared.html</u> or other template in your web browser and be able to preview content.
</p>
<p>
The idea of templates is to leave designer files un-changed and simply add tags where necessary. The HTML provided by designers would always contain some sample content, possibly a Lorem Ipsum text. Don't bother to remove it, just put Content tag around it.
</p>

<h2>Difference between static and dynamic content.</h2>
<p>
Whith your default .htaccess file in place requests to all the files ending with .html are being re-written and will be directed towards main.php. This file will initialize API of Agile Toolkit which then will process your request.
</p>
<p>
The first thing Agile Toolkit will do is try to determine the name of the page you are requesting. It does that by trimming extension. If you use <u>somepage.html</u> then <u>somepage/</u> would also work just as well. If you look into .htaccess file, you can enable new patterns for your URLs so that you can trick people with some funny URL extensions.
</p>
<p>
Once page name is determined, Agile Toolkit will attemt to perform 3 things<ul>
<li>Find a function inside API class</li>
<li>Find a class for appropriate page</li>
<li>Find a template inside <u>page/</u> with same name and .html extension</li>
