    <p>Dynamic SQL is a object-oriented model for building your query. It allows you to interact with the object in a structured way by adding additioal criterias, fields, joins or parameters, then the object is used natively by View elements.</p>

    <p>By it's nature DSQL allows some logical transparency of the back-end database storage, although the only actively used implementation is for MySQL</p>

    <p>To create new dsql instance call $this->api->db->dsql(); Connection to database must be established through (api->dbConnect). You can re-use same criteria different queries such as select and then update on a same object. Dsql object can also be safely cloned.</p>
