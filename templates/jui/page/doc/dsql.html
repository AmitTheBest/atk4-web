    <p>DSQL provides a way how you can modify the query of a certain class without the need to change the class itself. Sometimes multiple objects interract with DSQL object creating complex SQL query.</p>

    <p>DSQL supports select, update, insert, delete and some other queries. It hanles sub-queries, expressions and is always using PDO with parameters.</p>

    <p>You can also use DSQL object to query data, but the DSQL object will not hold the actual value for you. That's job for a "Model" class.</p>

    <h4>Compatibility with 4.1</h4>
    <p>In 4.2 a completely new DSQL / DB architecture was implemented. The older classes are still included for compatibility. The syntax remains almost identical, but the implementation is fundamentally different. Refer to compatibility guide for more information.</p>

    <p>Dynamic SQL is a object-oriented model for building your query. It allows you to interact with the object in a structured way by adding additioal criterias, fields, joins or parameters, then the object is used natively by View elements.</p>

    <p>By it's nature DSQL allows some logical transparency of the back-end database storage, although the only actively used implementation is for MySQL</p>

    <p>To create new dsql instance call $this->api->db->dsql(); Connection to database must be established through (api->dbConnect). You can re-use same criteria different queries such as select and then update on a same object. Dsql object can also be safely cloned.</p>
