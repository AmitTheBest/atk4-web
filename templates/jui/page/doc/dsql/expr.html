<h1>Understanding Expressions. Templates</h1>
<p>In previous sections of this documentation expr() was used few times as well as demonstrating how select queries are produced.
Each DSQL object has a "template" property which helps query to convert accumulated attributes into a SQL string. This process is
called Query Rendering. This is a typical query:</p>

<div class="atk_doc example"><code>
select [options] [fields] [from] [table] [join] [where] [group] [having] [order] [limit]
</code></div>

<p>When query is being rendered (simplest way to render a query is by converting it into a string), the arguments are filled-in by calling
methods such as render_options, render_fields, render_from, etc. Those functions will convert the parameters which were previously
supplied to the object into a string. If some of the parameters were supplied as objects, those will be recursively rendered.</p>

<h2>Writing your own templates</h2>
<p>Let's suppose you are willing to extend the query to make it support new query format:</p>
<?Code?>
class MyDSQL extends DB_dsql {
    function myfunc($arg){
        $this->args['myarg']=$arg;
        $this->setTemplate('myfunc([myarg])');
        return $this;
    }
    function render_myarg(){
        return $this->escape($this->args['myarg']);
    }
}
<?/?>
<p>The resulting code above will add ability to call your own stored procedure and specify an argument through a simple interface:</p>
<?Code?>
$result = $q->myfunc('abc')->getOne();
<?/?>

<p>You may also use subqueries and expresisons easily. When you pass string into escape() function it becomes a paramemtric variable. If you pass 
another query, it will be rendered and inserted as-is, therefore your code will automatically support:</p>

<?Code?>
$q=$this->api->db->dsql('MyDSQL');
$result = $q->myfunc($q->expr('2+2'))->getOne();
<?/?>

<p>You should understand that when myfunc() is called, the supplied argument is only stored as a reference.</p>

<h2>Standard Templates. Modes.</h2>
<p>DSQL implements some of the common queries already. Calling function insert() will automatically apply the "insert" template and will
affect the result. Sometimes, however, you would want to know which of those common queries were used. That's why there is a property $mode, which
is updated when you call insert(), update() or some other function which changes template.</p>

<?$Next?>
<p>The following modes are supported: select, insert, replace, update, delete, call.</p>
