<p>In previous sections of this documentation expr() was used few times as well as demonstrating how select queries are produced.
Each DSQL object has a "template" property, which is looking like this:</p>

<pre>
select [options] [fields] [from] [table] [join] [where] [group] [having] [order] [limit]
</pre>
