    <p>Application class is what binds and holds your web application together. During the execution of your web applcation, a single Application class is created
    and carries all the necessary tasks. Appplication class relies on many other classes such as <a href="<?page?>doc/api/controller<?/?>">Application Controllers</a> or <a href="<?page?>doc/page<?/?>">Pages</a> to do routing, URL generation, rendering, database operations and more.</p>

    <p>In your application you will define your own Application class. Of course you would excend it from one of the pre-defined Api classes, whichever suits yor nedes:</p>

        <?MoreInfo?>* Why API is also a View?
        <p>You may wonder, why Application class designed for command-line use extends the View. Why application is based on view in the first place?</p>
        <p>The reason is because in descendants such as ApiFrontend it's essential that application would have it's own template and be capable of rendering itself. This could have been done through a separate object, but we decided to keep it simple and make it this way.</p>
