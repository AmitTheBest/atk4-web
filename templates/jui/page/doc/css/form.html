<h1>Form classes</h1>

<p>Agile Toolkit forms may have several classes applied on them to change the way how they look:</p>

<h4>.stacked</h4>
<p>This class will make labels appear on top of input elements.</p>

<h4>.wider-labels</h4>
<p>For non-stacked form, this will slightly increase width of the label field.</p>


<h2>Field row</h2>
<p>Each field of a form is wrapped inside a div with class atk-form-row. This is defined in template form.html. This class will align label and input element properly. Additionally the row div may have .has-error class. This will make label red and will also highlight the field.</p>

<p>Placing &lt;ins&gt; element inside field's row will produce a gray "hint" next to the field. To add this field in the form, use the following code:</p>

<?Code?>
$form = $page->add('Form');
$field = $form->addField('line','test');

$field->setComment('Field Comment');
<?/?>

<p>Form field can have some additional HTML added above or below it. In HTML it's done by placing code either before or after input field or div.input-row. In PHP you can do this by calling $field->abovefield() and $field->belowField(); Those methods will insert and return an element which you can change the way you see fit:</p>

<?Code?>
$field->aboveField()->add('HelloWorld');

$filed->belowField()->setElement('img')->attr('src',$this->api->locateURL('images/logo.png'));
<?/?>

<h3>Adding buttons</h3>
<p>In several cases you would want to have a button linked with the field. In the HTML, this requires wrapping input field inside &lt;div class="input-row"&gt;. You can explore the actual markup on the "<a href="http://example.agiletoolkit.org/?page=playground">playground</a>" page. The PHP code for a similar operation looks relatively simple</p>

<?Code?>
$button = $field->addButton('Hello');
<?/?>

<p>Second argument to <a href="/dox/html/class_form___field.html#ab1da9f5c153f95719b832ce00dbe007b">addButton()</a> can be either "before" or "after" and is "after" by default. There are also functions afterField and beforeField() which work similarly to aboveField()/belowField()</p>
