<h1>Building layout with Grid System</h1>

<p>This topic is sufficiently covered in multiple tutorials. You can also look into alternative grid system implementation such as that in Bootstrap, 960.gs, Blueprint, etc.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit grid can be configured to work with either a fixed layout or flexible layout. @gridColumnWidth variable in atk-main.less can be specified in either percent or pixels.</p>

<p>Many Agile Toolkit add-ons will rely on standards CSS classes so even if you are not planning to use them, it's usually a good idea to leave them enabled.</p>
