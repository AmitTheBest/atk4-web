		<h2>Development Changes - August 2011</h2>


                <p>July and August were relatively calm and not many changes were done. This is because we were preparing and testing 4.1 release</p>

        <h4><span class="date">August 16<em>th</em></span><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/a0e46a0aaa0061c173ed716b5dc8c36c308c71bd">Add getColumn() to DBlite</a></h4>
<?Code?>
$array_of_values = $this->api->db->getColumn($query);


$array_of_values = $dq->do_getColumn();

        <p>Calling jui->addInclude() or js()->_load() will attempt to load JavaScript file dynamically through AJAX. Some 3rd party JavaScript add-ons do not like
        that. Previously developer would had to manually add include text into shared template, now you can simply call:
<?Code?>
$this->api->jui->addStaticInclude('myjsfile');
