<?page_title_del?>Benefits and Features<?/?>

<?seo_descr?>Agile Toolkit is a powerful Web User Interface framework which introduces high-level abstraction to almost all aspects of modern web development. Without leaving comfort of PHP language, you can change page contents, routing, AJAX behaviour, JavaScrit bindings, Model structure and ORM rules.

</ul>

<h3>Controllers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Controllers have different responsiblities in Agile Toolkit</li>
<li>Front-controller is implemented as Page object</li>
<li>Libraries are Application-Controllers. They extend how application behaves</li>
<li>Helpers in other frameworks may be either Controller or View for better structure</li>
<li>Apply one or several controllers on a single object.</li>
<li>Model controllers adds behvaiour, conditions, fields or encryption to models</li>
<li>Controllers are transparent. Strong encryption controller is attached to model where fields continue to work ir a regular way</li>
<li>Register system-wide fall-back functions.</li>
<li>Inject methods into objects.</li>
<li>Advanced object-level "hook" system</li>
</ul>

<h3>Views</h3>
<ul>
<li>Views produce HTML markup, such as button, form, image or icon</li>
<li>One view can recursively consist of other views</li>
<li>All views rely on a simple-for-designers-to-understand HTML templates</li>
<li>Template engine contain no business logic, only define regions</li>
<li>When adding view to another, position it anywhere in owner's template</li>
<li>Views generate and insert unique-name for each object</li>
<li>Function js() allows to bind view with jQuery chains through behaviours</li>
<li>Reload view through AJAX painlessly</li>
<li>Regardless of complexity, multiple views will not conflict on same page</li>
<li>AJAX request can render selective view</li>
<li>Views are rendered after everything is initialized. Hence you can delete views after they are added.</li>
<li>Because Views are classes, they can inherit each-other</li>
<li>Agile Toolkit comes with many built-in views</li>
<li>CRUD is implemented as view, hence you can have multiple CRUD controls on the page</li>
<li>You can use views for layouting or tabs.</li>
<li>View can have default template, but you can specify a different template when adding</li>
<li>You can convert view into HTML by echoing it, but never do it. Render will echo everything for you</li>
<li>Output is echo'ed only once, after render, so the page will not be displayed partially</li>
<li>You can re-arrange objects in a view after they are added through controller</li>
<li>Grid based on pure HTML with support for Paginator, Sorting, Totals and inline editing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Application</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multiple API classes are available. Select the most appropriate for your web app</li>
<li>Support for lightweight config file (php syntax)</li>
<li>Full-featured implementation of exception handling</li>
<li>Application is derived from View, hence it has a global template (shared.html)</li>
<li>Through controllers, add more SEO capabilities to your web application</li>
<li>Transparent localization support. Develop your app, then localize</li>
<li>Upgrade full Agile Toolkit codebase or addons without loosing your customization</li>
<li>Inject your own classes (Form, Grid) to be used everywhere</li>
<li>Create multiple applicaiton instances</li>
<li>Support for skins allowing to white-label software</li>
<li>PathFinder helps locate files in multiple locations based on file type</li>
<li>Certain template tags are universally changed to set proper page-links or location to HTML assets</li>
<li>Add authentication controller to restrict access on white or black-list basis.</li>
<li>Authentication can use default login form or your own</li>
<li>Multiple encryptions for authentication - md5, sha1, sha256 and your own</li>
<li>Presence of Sticky GET arguments</li>
<li>Page-based routing. Can be extended through .htaccess into Ruby-style. Use any extension in URL</li>
<li>Support for mod_rewrite.</li>
<li>Apps can be deployed in webroot or subdirectory</li>
<li>Support for sub-pages and page hierarchies.</li>
<li>Inherit one page from another</li>
<li>Backwards-compatibility controller</li>
<li>Database migration scripts (alter table)</li>
<li>Development and Production mode</li>
<li>File pushing. Place file with the same name in local directory to override file from Agile Toolkit</li>

<h2>JavaScript and jQuery Integration</h2>
<p>JavaScript and jQuery are fundamental technologies in any modern web application. Agile Toolkit brings abstraction of powerful technologies such as AJAX making them more reliable and easier to use. It's very easy to start using: $page->add('Button')->js('click', $grid->js()->reload() );

<h3>jQuery Integration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any view in the system can have jQuery chain attached through behaviour, such as "click"</li>
<li>Behaviour on one object can trigger chain on another object</li>
<li>Multiple PHP calls on chain transparently converted into JavaScript code. Argument types are converted.</li>
<li>One behaviour can trigger multiple chains.</li>
<li>You can use your own events and trigger them manually.</li>
<li>Redefine selector or use "this", "document" or "window".</li>
<li>Submitting form executes jQuery chain also.</li>
<li>Enclose chain into function.</li>
</ul>

<h3>jQuery UI extension</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid multiple requests when user clicks AJAX button inpatiently</li>
<li>Handle slow page loading to display global spinner</li>
<li>Ability to handle session expiration in AJAX requests</li>
<li>jQuery UI widget for form. Adds AJAX submit and nice error display</li>
<li>jQuery UI widget for grid. Add field reloading, pagination</li>
<li>jQuery UI widget for expander. Expands table and loads page inside</li>
<li>Plugin for "atk4_loader". Improves for content loading and reloading</li>
<li>Extensible univ.js chain allowing to add more custom JS methods accessible from PHP</li>
<li>Support for dynamic loading and JS dependencies.</li>
<li>Load AJAX page along with 3rd party jQuery plugins and widgets</li>
<li>Growl-style JS success notification</li>
<li>Native support of jQuery UI dialogs</li>
