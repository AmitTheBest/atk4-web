Agile Toolkit is a PHP5 based framework developed by Agile Technologies. Toolkit includes a solid MVC framework, large number of ready-to-use widgets and controllers and are specifically designed for Web Software development in a rapid and Agile way.

Toolkit is split in 2 components:
<ul>
<li>Agile Toolkit Core - providing efficient implementation to any other frameworks
<li>ATK Interface Library - introduces set of visual components and incredibly speeds up development of UI.
</ul>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">1. Highly re-usable modules</td>
<td>Typical Software as a Service (SaaS) application has 80% of code that overlays other similar applications. </br></br>
Re-usage of components makes it:
<ol><li>Quicker to make thus cheaper</li>
<li>Less mistakes & more functionality</li>
<li>Lets focus on the unique parts of your software</li></ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">2. Front end interface design</td>
<td>About 30% time and budget in each project is spend developing front end HTML & User Interface (UI). User Interface is most powerful selling point for SaaS applications so a lot of investment goes just to make project competitive. </br></br>
Default UI benefits:
<ol>
<li>Allows interface to be consistent over all application</li>
<li>Developer can create simple application without involving designer or knowing HTML</li>
<li>Follows design guidelines and standards</li>
<li>Designer can develop templates that will be later applied to software</li>
</ol>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">3. Security included</td>
<td>Framework is built according to general practices and recommendations for secure software published by <a href="http://www.owasp.org/">OWASP</a> and takes responsibility of maintaining security away from developers. </br></br>
What it means for developer:
<ol>
<li>Don't have to worry about security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Less testing and audits involved</li>
<li>Security standards are already in place</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">4. Business goal oriented design</td>
<td>Agile Toolkit was built with a business owners in mind. Framework requires less training and has extensive documentations for every business feature you would need.</br></br>
<ol>
<li>Less training involved</li>
<li>Business goals can be achieved in minutes</li>
<li>Simple and extensive <a href="">documentation</a></li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">5. Newest technology</td>
<td>Microsoft, Apple and Google are collaboratively promoting newest technological standards for web. For other companies to take advantage of those new technologies takes a lot of learning and getting used to.</br></br>
Agile Framework allows you to:
<ol>
<li>Produce great results with HTML5, JavaScript and CSS</li>
<li>Includes technologies such as jQuery, jQuery UI and MVC</li>
<li>Creates richer client-side software using AJAX technologies</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">6. Split between team members</td>
<td>Typical web project would include architect, user interface developer, designer and business analyst. What if dependencies on each-other would be less critical?</br></br>
Role separating between members mean:
<ol>
<li>Less management and paperwork</li>
<li>You don't have to put them in one room to deliver result</li>
<li>Each person can focus on what they know best</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">7. Fast and highly scalable</td>
<td>Modularity and Object-Oriented-Design of the software and frameworks enables dynamic activation of different components. For instance if user looks at his profile page, then code responsible for building "login" page is not used.</br></br>
Dynamically loads visual elements such as Forms, Grids, Tables and Menus only if they are required. If AJAX is used to re-draw Form then other components are excluded. Similar approach works on frontend with JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery UI components loaded on demand. This makes software fast and efficient.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">8. Integrated</td>
<td>Many frameworks decide to have as less dependencies as possible. Using them often limits developer in terms of licensing and leaves a huge code footprint. In contract Agile Toolkit relies on standard components such as XML, DOM and XSLT to perform all the tasks. Most of the work is done by relevant PHP extensions.</br></br>
<ol>
<li>Make your solution highly customisable and extensive</li>
<li>Easier to maintain in long term</li>
<li>No licensing implications of 3rd party modules</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">9. Supported</td>
<td>If you have ever used open source software, you should know that it always comes "as is". Creators of the software bear no warranty. Eventually software achieves good results (such as Linux, Apache or PHP itself), but it requires high level of control, management and at least 2 major rewrites.</br></br>
Agile Toolkit has commercial license that allows us to hire developer team for polishing and perfecting our product. We can work on additional components which are in demand for commercial users and offer continuos growth and integration.

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">10. Licensing</td>
<td>Agile Toolkit is licensed per developer per year. With introduction of cloud computing and the physical limits on CPU speeds, more and more people are looking for horizontal scaling - that is running more computers to do the job. We don't charge you per server and we don't charge you if you use our software to do open source projects. This is much reasonable licensing on longer run.
