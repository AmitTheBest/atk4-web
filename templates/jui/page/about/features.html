<h1>Agile Toolkit features</h1>

<p>Agile Toolkit is a powerful Web User Interface framework which introduces high-level abstraction to almost all aspects of modern web development. Without leaving comfort of PHP language, you can change page contents, routing, AJAX behaviour, JavaScrit bindings, Model structure and ORM rules.</p>

<p>The Toolkit was heavily influenced by the Object-Oriented windowed environment. For instance reliance on "init" method as a secondary constructor comes from Turbo Vision and many of other approaches are coming from Object Windows frameworks and Objective C / Cocoa used in Apple UI. The true goal however was to keep flexibility required by Web projects, instead of porting concepts.</p>


<p>Development in Agile Toolkit is fun and is very addictive. Agile Toolkit is popular amongst new developers. They are excited to step over huge chunk of technologies and concepts (HTML,CSS,JSON,HTTP,AJAX,YAML,XML,960GS) and just get to the coding. Mature developers mostly like efficient and flexible architecture or Agile Toolkit and ability to extend and re-use code.</p>

<p>Website www.agiletoolkit.org also is built using Agile Toolkit. Sources are available under open-source license.</p>

<p>Ability to use same framework for site like this one and also to build complex online financial software is a great testament for flexibility and scaling of Agile Toolkit. Once you are familiar with Agile Toolkit, you will see how it can help you with a very wide variety of tasks. Build a single-page contact-to-email form, customized CMS system, document management or financial system - Agile Toolkit always offers a faster, cleaner and more intuitive way to complete your project.</p>

<td valign="top" width="200">1. Full Object Oriented MVC</td>
<td>
<p>Implementation of MVC in Agile Toolkit differs from the one introduced by Ruby-on-Rails. MVC is implemented on Object level (not page level). Also in contrast from using "YAML" to define models and "HTML" to describe views, all three are implemented as PHP class objects. Form, Button and Grid are examples of View class objects. Controllers are also implemented as classes which can be optionally used to extend behaviour. The special type of MVC controller can optionally bind View with ORM-powered object of Model class.Things on your pages are controlled by Page class objects.</p>
<p>While it might sound like way more complex structure, in reality it is really intuitive and natural. A huge advantage is ability to use instances of generic classes as-is and omitting some elements. The code is much more logically linked and re-usability of components is on a really high level.</p>

<ol><li>Much more modular built around true object-oriented design (not class singletons)</li>
<li>Inheritance is optional. You do not need to define new class to build a form (but you can)</li>
<li>Things working by default. Generic objects just work. More tweaking, less coding.</li></ol>

<td valign="top">2. Web User Interface Included</td>
<td><p>With Agile Toolkit you can forget your troubles with HTML, CSS, AJAX, JavaScript and User Interface in general. Instead of forcing web developers to provide endless chunks of HTML, Agile Toolkit comes with two high-quality themes. Featuring best practices of design, typography and layout building - you would be using jQuery UI CSS Framework integrated with flexible CSS Grid System.</p>

<p>Supplied JavaScript widgets compliment standard interface of jQuery UI to add many essential features and enable development of Rich Web Software.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit allows to do things by either taking advantage of bundled UI, or by letting you do it your way. You may build custom templates for pages, forms, views or menu and then let developers selectively apply them where appropriate or globally.

<ol>
<li>Agile Toolkit is bundled with gorgeous CSS/HTML templates. You still have full to customize the theme.</li>
<li>If you wish, you can replace create your own HTML skin from scratch either for new or existing project.</li>
<li>Templates for Agile Toolkit can be significantly enhanced with new components and rules suitable for multi-regional software and white-label solutions.</li>

</ol>

<td><p>Abstraction layer significantly improves security when you copy data between database, JavaScript and templates. Even without validation, proper escaping and encoding is always in place. Developers not aware of security precautions will feel confident working in environment of Agile Toolkit</p>
<ol>
<li>Security applied by default and can not be lifted by accident.</li>
<li>Integration between user interface and ORM ensures seamless and secure data handling.</li>
<li>Any new component or addon will have the same security policies as anything else</li>

<!--
<p>Agile Toolkit is a culmination of 10-years of web framework perfection and improvements. Initial versions in 2001 had model definition separated from CRUD implementation, very similar to CRUD components you can see today in many frameworks. However during 3 major rewrites and a lot of fine-tuning Agile Toolkit is on a completely new level. Components such as CRUD consist of many smaller components which in </p>
-->

<p>Goals pursued by Agile Toolkit benefits most projects which focus on efficiency, scalability, performance. Approach of Agile Toolkit towards code ownership as well as separation of "your" code, "3rd party" code and "core components" is much better though through.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit focuses on your staff productiveness and steep learning curve. In our testing, average developer will be able to make a simple yet usable web application in few days since introduction. After one month developers are completely in love with the framework and can easily out-perform mature developers using other web frameworks.</p>

<p>When it comes to bindings, Agile Toolkit chooses to support one, most popular technique. For instance, we spend our effort into improving integration with MySQL instead of building layers of CPU-burning abstractions to support 20 different databases in ORM. Front-end is clearly focused on jQuery / jQuery UI combination. With Agile Toolkit you get experience, not munch of components under 'no-warranty' license.
<ol>
<li>Great environment with a lot of focus on small and medium size business requirements.</li>
<li>Training experience of your employees is highly efficient and completely free.</li>
<li>Many low-level choices are done for you. You may decide to use them or not.</li>
<li>No automated generation of bloated code. Achieve more with less files and simpler code.</li>

<td valign="top">5. Sustainable development and support</td>
<td><p>Many PHP frameworks can be acquired for free. However we know that even free framework comes with a cost, which you spend on learning and using it. Agile Toolkit is free to use in open-source software, education and non-profit groups and organizations. However if you are making money by selling your on-line software as a service, you will need to acquire a per-developer license.</p>

<p>Agile Technologies - a hi-end web development company who have developed and released Agile Toolkit continues to support and improve both the framework and documentation funded by your purchases and not over-priced consulting services.</p>

<p>The free license used by Agile Toolkit - Affero GPL promotes open-source movement by prompting developers to contribute and open source their projects as well as give chance to smaller companies to release and distribute commercial software or components much easier.</p>

<ol>
<li>Highly-motivated developers work to improve Agile Toolkit on daily basis ensuring high quality of code, integration and consistency.</li>
<li>You can get exactly the same code-base for free. If you go commercial, the value you are getting greatly exceeds commercial cost.</li>
<li>Developers who chose to use Agile Toolkit for free are motivated by licensing terms to contribute and improve community based on quality code sharing.</li>

<td valign="top">6. Proven to be best with Agile Methodologies</td>
<td><p>Agile Manifesto provides a guidelines for building a better-motivated and more efficient development teams. Agile Toolkit greatly compliments principles such as "deliver early" and "refactoring".</p>

<p>When you adopt Agile Toolkit in your team, separate developers, designers and content writers can work on your web software independently without friction. You can develop application completely and apply design after it's finished with even less effort than doing same thing other way around</p>

<p>Testing in Agile Toolkit is much easier. Firstly there are many things you wouldn't need to test, such as your user interface. It's very robust is very stable even if your application only relies on AJAX interaction. Agile Toolkit focuses testing on back-end business logic in an automated and visual way.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can start one development then change any aspect of your software without any penalty.</li>
<li>In your team each member can work on their professional area with minimum dependencies between members.</li>
<li>You will achieve much higher quality build with less testing. You can use browser-side software for UI testing.</li>

<td valign="top">7. Way ahead of competition</td>
<td>
<p>Agile Toolkit have been developed for over 10 years. Some components and approaches pre-date mainstream. Dynamic query engine was introduced in 2004. ORM was designed in 2009 and is step ahead of other mainstream ORM implementation. JavaScript and jQuery integration designed in 2010 is few years ahead of competition.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit 4 culminates implementation of User Interface layer and by relying on many modern standards such as HTML5, Progessive Enhancemen, CSS degradation delivers a solid architecture for the next 5 years of web development.</p>

<p>While competition is trying to add every possible feature, Agile Toolkit stays very focused on real-life scenarios and practices. Agile Toolkit does not use singletons, namespaces, globals, constants. It promotes use of PHP-based validation engine instead of bundling one. It discourages use of private and protected properties and clases due to specific nature of configuring objects externally and implementation of controllers. Agile Toolkit is not compatible with 3rd party ORM, Template engines. Native implementations of those components exhibit much better performance smaller code footprint due to integration and clever design.

<ol>
<li>For 10 years Agile Toolkit has been ahead of innovation and will remain strong.</li>
<li>Agile Toolkit is proud to be lightweight and most full-featured. Agile Tolokit is often about "simple-yet-extensible" solution as opposed to "all-in-one" solutions.
<li>Availability of technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, PHP5.2 makes Agile Toolkit much simpler than frameworks designed earlier.</li>
<li>No caching. Agile Toolkit is to fast to use caching. Seriously.</li>
