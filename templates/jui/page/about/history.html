<h1>History of Agile Toolkit</h1>
<p>Agile Toolkit have a rich history. It's been called previously as AModules and have been started in 1999. Library have been completely rewritten several times throughout it's lifespan - when first migrated PHP4 and when alpha version of PHP5 (Zend2) become available.</p>

<p>Toolkit have been heavily influenced by Object-Oriented windowed environment. For instance reliance on "init" method as a secondary constructor comes from Turbo Vision and many of other approaches are coming from Object Windows frameworks and Objective C / Cocoa used in Apple UI. The true goal however was to keep flexibility required by Web projects, instead of porting concepts.</p>

<p>Historically by several measurements Agile Toolkit and it's ancestors have introduced several concepts before other frameworks did. For example dynamic queries were used in AModules3 since 2004 for both queries, updates, deletes and other operations. Even today many frameworks only have "select" support for dynamic queries.</p>
