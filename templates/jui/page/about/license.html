<?seo_keywords?>license, commercial, agpl, open source, start ups, enterprises, freelancers<?/?>

<p>Agile Toolkit can be used for free in personal, open-source or intranet software as well as web software backends with restricted access. In those cases you do not need to make your source frely available.</p>

<p>If you are building web service (SaaS) or software which will be used by many public users (Downloadable web app), then you need to either offer to download your software source or hold a valid developer's license. Having a developer license permits you to distribute your app as a closed-source app.</p>

<p>You can avoid licensing cost by not developing yourself, but rather letting <a href="<?page?>engage<?/?>">other licensed developer</a> write software for you.</p>

<h3>Open-Source license - liabilities and benefits</h3>
<p>You can use Agile Toolkit under the terms of Affero General Public License. You will receive all source code for free (as in free speech). Code comes as-is without warranty or commercial support.</p>
<p>According to AGPL terms, you need to let people who use your code also be able to download or get access to source code (such as including link to your public GitHub repository.</p>
<p>You can still charge your users for your service, data or premium features as long as you distribute source code or contribute it to original author of the open-source software.</p>

<?MoreInfo?>Why is it paid? Software must be free!
<p>We agree absolutely. We have put over 5 man-years into Agile Toolkit and now giving it away for free. All you need to do is to open-source your software and make this world a better place.</p>

<p>If you can't open-source your software, license cost is a fair trade-off which will help us fund this amazing and innovative framework.

<h2>Licensing Questions and Answers</h2>

<?MoreInfo?>I am Freelancer / Web development company. If we use ATK, will our client need to pay extra?
<p>
No. If you or your company already hold a "Developer license", any software you produce can be used anywhere without extra charges. You would need to advise your client, that he will need a licensed developer to work with his software. That benefits you both - as freelancer you would have more returning customers. Client will benefit from the quality work by licensed developers, who are commited to Agile Toolkit.</p>

<p>If you don't normally use Agile Toolkit, you can also purchase license for single domain, and pass those cost to your client. Single-domain license never expires and is one-time payment.</p>

<?MoreInfo?>We own proprietary Agile Toolkit software built by a 3rd party. Can we modify it?
<p>
You would need a licensed developer to do modifications. You can find some companies on <a href="/engage/">Engage</a> page. If you want to do modifications yourself, you can purchase a single-domain license and never worry about it.

<p>
