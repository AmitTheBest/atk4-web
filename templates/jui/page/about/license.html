<p>Agile Toolkit offers licenses for commercial and open source development.
</p><p>
<h2>Open-source License</h2>
<p>Our open-source license is most suitable for other open-source projects as well as your internal projects. </p>

<h3>Open-Source projects</h3>
<p>We believe in open-source software so we have made the open-source version available free of charge. If you are using an open-source version of Agile Toolkit it comes with AGPL license.</p>

<p>Many web applications such as Drupal, Wordpres, phpMyAdmin and more are using GPL license. Unfortunately a regular GPL license does not enforce availability of source code if someone builds a commercial web service using GPL code. Affero GPL license addresses that by requesting that a download source link would be present.</p>

<h3>Commercial projects</h3>
<p>In many cases publishing your software source code is more beneficial even in commercial project. For example, you can take an free open-source AGPL web project, build a hosted service with subscription then charge users for your hosted services. They still can download your software and use it locally. This is a great opportunity for you to promote your on-line resource. Think wordpress.com or kaltura.com.</p>

<p>If you are building highly customised software for your own use, still — open-source it. It will help others to learn the toolkit or perhaps even help you to improve your software</p>

<h2>Using Commercial  License</h2>
<p>100s of commercial web projects have been developed using the Agile Toolkit under the commercial license. This ensures that the source code is fully owned by your company.</p>

<h3>Start ups</h3>
<p>Typically if you are building a start-up or getting investors for your web venture, they would want you to keep your intellectual property hidden. You would need a commercial license if you wish to work on such projects.</p>


<h3>Enterprises</h3>
<p>For business critical software, the commercial license ensures that you receive full support for our development issues.</p>

<h3>Freelancers</h3>
<p>If you are a freelancer, you can learn how to use the Agile Toolkit using open-source software. Once you are working with clients, we would advise you to upgrade to the commercial license so that the code that you write for them is covered by the commercial terms. You can also list your services on the <a href="/commercial/jobs">Jobs</a> page.</p>

<h3>Offshore development companies</h3>
<p>This is a great opportunity for you to list your services on your <a href="/commercial/jobs">Jobs</a> page. You can list yourself even if you are not licensed, however you are much more likely to win projects if you are holding active license.</p>


<?MoreInfo?>I am Freelancer / Web development company. If we use ATK, will our client need to pay extra?
<p>
No. The Agile Toolkit licenses is issued to developers. If you have 2 developers in your company you will need two licenses. You can develop unlimited amount of software based on Agile Toolkit and sell / distribute it to clients with no licensing restrictions. If your clients are only using software you made for them — they do not need to purchase license.
</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>After software is deployed, will we need to continue pay for licensing?
<p>
Only if you are developing it. If you require only occasional changes, you could ask a <a href="/commercial/jobs">licensed developer</a> to do them for you.
</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>We own proprietary software built by a 3rd party. Can we modify it?
<p>
You would need a licensed developer to do modifications. This is to ensure that your software quality do not degrade. However you can freely change templates if you only need to do visual changes.
</p>
<p>Alternatively you can open-source your software. In this case you can always ask support from community if you encounter problem.</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>How can we switch between free and proprietary licenses?
<p>
If you have purchased a commercial license, you can download the up-to-date commercial ATK distribution license. Simply replace your "atk4" folder.</p>
<p>You can download the open-source ATK from the <a href="/download/">download page</a>.
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>For how long is the commercial license purchased?
<p>
The commercial license must be renewed annually. The license is for development work only. If for some reason you stop developing using the Agile Toolkit, there is no need to renew your license. All your existing software project developed in the Agile Toolkit can continue run regardless of whether you have a license or not.
