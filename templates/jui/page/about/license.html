<h1>Dual Licensing of Agile Toolkit</h1>
<p>Agile Toolkit uses a Dual License business model for its software development modules and offers licenses for commercial and opens source development.
</p><p>
<h2>Using Open-source License</h2>
<p>Our Open-source license is most suitable for other open-source projects as well as your internal projects. </p>

<h3>Open-Source projects</h3>
<p>We believe in open-source software. Our decision not to provide Agile Toolkit under MIT license is in order to support Open-Source movement. If you are using a free version of Agile Toolkit it comes with AGPL license.</p>

<p>Many web applicaitons such as Drupal, Wordpres, phpMyAdmin and more are using GPL license. Unfortunatelly a regular GPL license does not enforce availability of source code if someone builds a commercial web service using GPL code. Affero GPL license addresses that by requesting that a download source link would be present.</p>

<h3>Commercial projects</h3>
<p>In many cases publishing your software source code is more beneficial even in commercial project. For example, you can take an free open-source AGPL web project, build a hosted service with subscription then charge users for your hosted services. They still can download your software and use it locally. This is a great opportunity for you to promote your on-line resource. Think wordpress.com or kaltura.com.</p>

<p>If you are building highly customised software for your own use, still — open-source it. It will help others to learn the toolkit or perhaps even help you to improve your softawre</p>

<h2>Using Proprietary License</h2>
<p>Ourselves and other commercial companies develop web projects using Agile Toolkit on a daily basis. Those companies are using commercial license of the Agile Toolkit. Apart from the license agreement, nothing in the source code is different.</p>

<h3>Proprietary projects with sensetive Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>Typically if you are building a start-up or getting investors for your web venture, they would want you to keep your intellectual property hidden. You would need proprietary license if you wish to work on such projects.</p>


<h3>Enterprise projects</h3>
<p>In larger organisations it is much more beneficial to use commercial verison of Agile Toolkit. This ensures that you are receiving proper commercial support.</p>

<h3>Freelancers</h3>
<p>If you are a freelancer, take your time to learn Agile Toolkit using open-source version. However we are pretty sure that by using Agile Toolkit in your projects, you will be able to reduce cost by much more than a monthly license fee of Agile Toolkit.</p>

<h3>Offshore development companies</h3>
<p>This is a great opportunity for you to list your services on your <a href="/commercial/jobs">Jobs</a> page. You can list yourself even if you are not licensed, however you are much more likely to win projects if you are holding active license.</p>


<?MoreInfo?>I am Freelancer / Web development company. If we use ATK, will our client need to pay extra?
<p>
No. Agile Toolkit licenses are issued to developers. If you have 2 developers in your company you will need two licenses. You can develop unlimited amount of software based on Agile Toolkit and sell / distribute it to clients with no licensing restrictions. If your clients are only using software you made for them — they do not need to purchase license.
</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>After software is deployed, will we need to continue pay for licensing?
<p>
Only if you are developing it. If you require only occasinal changes, ask some <a href="/commercial/jobs">licensed developer</a> to do them for you.
</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>We own proprietary software built by 3rd party. Can we modify it?
<p>
You would need a licensed developer to do modifications. This is to ensure that your software quality do not degrade. However you can freely change templates if you only need to do visual changes.
</p>
<p>Alternatively you can open-source your software. In this case you can alwasy ask support from community if you encounter problem.</p>
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>How can we switch between free and proprietary licenses?
<p>
If you have purchased proprietary license, you will have access information for download of an up-to-date commercial ATK distribution. Simply replace your "atk4" folder.</p>
<p>You can always download open-source ATK from <a href="/download/">download page</a>.
<?/?>

<?MoreInfo?>For how long commercial license is purchased?
<p>
Commercial license must be renewed annualy. If for some reason you no longer develop uning Agile Toolkit, you do not need to renew your license. All your existing software project can continue to run.
