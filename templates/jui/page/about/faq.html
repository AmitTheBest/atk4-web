<p>The Open-source license does not prevent you from charging for use of the software service. Many Software-as-a-Service sites rely on open-source software. The majority of your users would still prefer to use a maintained hosted version of the software regardless of availability of source code. The existence of an open-source project can also often help to promote your service. For a successful story of this model, refer to wordpress.com.</p>

<p> The main reason is because the BSD license does not help to promote the Open-Source movement.</p>
