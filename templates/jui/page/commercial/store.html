We believe in open-source software. That is why we are willing to offer 10 years of our work on this library for free. But there is a catch. If you build your software using free version of Agile Toolkit, you have to make your software code freely available as well. Our choice of the open-source license is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">Affero General Public License</a> - the license specifically written for Web Software.</br></br>

Questions
1) Will we provide credits similar to ExtJS where they can report only 40 issues per year on standard and 175 / 750 per year on premium?
