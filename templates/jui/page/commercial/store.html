<h2>Why Purchase?</h2>
<p>Agile Toolkit is a fast-paced framework backed by a company. To keep the quality of support, continiously bring out new add-ons and improve the basic structure, we continiously employ some awesome developers and designers. With a free (permissive) distribution model we wouldn't be able to provide fast-evolving, innovative technology inside Agile Toolkit.</p>

<p>If you do not own license for your domain, your projects source code must be available for it's users as per requirements of Affero General Public License. This promotes open-source and makes Agile Toolkit available to anyone.</p>

<p>You do not need to have a commercial license while your commercial application is in development and you are only using it within your development team. When you launch your website, you must purchase the appropriate license.</p>

<p>If you are only developing yoru application back-end in Agile Toolkit you will have a limited circle of users who can ask you for a source code personally. If you are using Agile Toolkit without licensing, please keep the footer text inact with the link to agiletoolkit.org.</p>

<h2>Personal and Educational Use</h2>
<p>For your personal, in-house projects you do neet to worry about license at all as you wouldn't be sharing it with anyone. If you are building projects for a group of friends or just for fun, strongly consider publishing source code on github and include the link inside your application.
