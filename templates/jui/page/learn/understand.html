        <p>As you have already read in <a href="<?page?>learn/intro<?/?>">Objects and Web</a>, Agile Toolkit is a fully
        Object-Oriented environment and implements everything as objects. There are 5 types of objects - Application, Page,
        Model, View and Controller.</p>

        <p>This section will give you opportunity to dip into each of the types, however before that, let's start with
        things which apply to all of the code â€” the basics</p>

        <h3>Don't over-think it!</h3>
        <p>Many experienced developers make the mistake of trying too think too much. How rendering is done? How form data is submitted? How AJAX is used? Let go of those things and leave it to Agile Toolkit. Focus on your task. Keep it simple.</p>

        <p>If you are not entirely satisfied the minor details, leave them for later. Anything you can do in conventional web development can also be done in Agile Toolkit, although the way you do it might be different.</p>
