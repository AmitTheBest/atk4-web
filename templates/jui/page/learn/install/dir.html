        <h1>Directory Structure</h1>
        <p>Let's go over your example installation and see which directories are there. The default directory layout
        can be changed as per your requirement. For example, if you want to share certain libraries between multiple
        sites or interfaces, this can be easily done through a clas of Agile Toolkit called PathFinder.</p>

        <h3>Local files, atk4 and atk4-addons</h3>
        <p>If you have looked inside 'atk4' directory you would have noticed that it has similar directories as your
        example application. When Agile Toolkit is looking for certain file, it looks first in your "local" directory.
        If file is not found there, then it looks inside atk4 directory. Finally it looks inside atk4-addons directories.

        <h3>Copy-On-Modify principle</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit virtually requires only one or two files at the minimum. As you enhance or change default 
        behaviour of Agile Toolkit, you might want to change files. You must never change files inside 'atk4' folder.
        Instead extend them if they are PHP classes. If it's impossible to achieve your result through extending, you
        can "push" your own verson of the class, image, stylesheet or HTML template by placing it outside "atk4" folder
        with identical name. For example by creating file templtes/jui/images/logo.png you can replace default logo
        with your own. However, never store identical copy without modification. This may backfire if Agile Toolkit will
        introduce changes to those files.</p>



        <h3>Resource Types</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit relies on the concept of "resource type" when it attempts to use a file. The most used resource
        types are: <ul>
        <li>php — class definition which are not directly available, but is loaded automatically, when class is used;</li>
        <li>page — page classes, which are can be accessible by specifying class name in the URL;</li>
        <li>js — javascript includes;</li>
        <li>template — files related to presentation, HTML, CSS and Images;</li>
        <li>mail — mail templates.</li>
        </ul>
        The resource types are looked up in certain location by default, however there are ways how new locations can be
        added for a purpose such as storing shared content or introducing new logical separation</p>




        <h3>Essential files and folders</h3>
        <p>Nearly all the files and directories are optional. You shouldn't create them unless they are needed.</p>
<?Higlight?><pre>
.htaccess           — contains mod_rewrite instructions
atk4                — unmodified copy of Agile Toolkit.
atk4-addons         — unmodified copy of Agile Toolkit Addons.
config-default.php  — default configuration settings.
config-distrib.php  — template for config.php. This file typically is
                        copied into config.php when your software is installed.
config.php          — install-specific configuration options, such as database connection
                        settings, etc. DO NOT add this file into Version Control System.
doc                 — your software documentation, database initialzation and update scripts
index.php           — file containing Agile Toolkit bootstrap code.
lib                 — your PHP code, php resource type.
page                — contains classes used for routing, "page" resource type.  test/foo.html
                        would use class from page/test/foo.php named page_test_foo 
templates/          — technically, the only location apart from index.php to be accessible
                        directly from the web.
templates/default   — overrides certain files of default template. Only place changed files here.
templates/js        — contains your own javascript plugins.
templates/mail      — mail templates
upload              — webserver-writable directory for filestore add-on
</pre><?/?>
        <h3>Essential files in atk4</h3>
        <p>You will notice, that atk4 folder have a similar structure:</p>
<?Higlight?><pre>
lib                 — Agile Toolkit PHP code, php resource type.
loader.php          — File, which you must include from index.php.
templates/          — technically, the only location apart from index.php to be accessible
                        directly from the web.
templates/default   — default HTML/CSS theme
templates/elephant  - alternative HTML/CSS theme
templates/shared    — shared components for all HTML/CSS themes

templates/xslt      — some XSLT templates
tools               — supplimentary command-line utilities
</pre><?/?>

        <h3>Essential files in atk4-addons</h3>
        <p>Addon structure contains some additional classes and other resources. Typically
        when you are using addon documentation, it will include instructions on how to enable
        that addon. By default no resources are looked up in atk4-addons. You will need to add
        this inside API init method:</p>
<?Code?>
$this->addLocation('atk4-addons',array(
    'template'=>'misc/templates',
    'php'=>array('mvc',
        'billing/lib',
        'misc/lib',
        'crm/lib',
        )
    ))
    ->setParent($this->pathfinder->base_location);
<?/Code?>
<?Higlight?><pre>
misc/templates      — some additional HTML/CSS templates
misc/lib            — small classes and views, which can be considered helpers. Feel free to
                        either use them as they are or copy them into your local lib/ directory
                        if you need to introduce modifications. If you contribute some useful
                        classes, they will be added here
misc/docs           — some universal resources, such as create script for 'country' table with
                        up-to-date list of countries, filestore creation scripts. If you need
                        to use them in your application, create symlink from inside your
                        docs directory.
mvc                 — Model-View-Controller implementation. To be moved into atk4/ soon
billing             — implementation of some billing processors
