        <h1>Installing Required Software for Agile Toolkit</h1>

        <p>Before you start learning Agile Toolkit, we advise you to have it insstalled on your local computer. Alternatively
        you can use a standalone web-server, however in our guides we will be assuming, that you can access your local
        webserver at http://localhost/</p>

        <p>We suggest you to use one of the Apache+PHP+MySQL bundles, which are available for any operating system. For 
        example, if you are on windows, download and install WAMP. Of course there are alternatives, which you can also
        use. You would need to have PHP verison 5.2, however we recommend to use 5.3+.</p>

        <p>While developing in Agile Toolkit, you woul be creating a lot of *.php files. You should get a good text editor,
        such as Notepad++ for Windows or Coda for Mac OSX.</p>

        <p>All the software here is free and can be downloaded from the following links:</p>

        <h3>Windows Software</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>WAMP - <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">http://www.wampserver.com/en/</a>
        <li>Notepad++ - <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Mac OSX Software</h3>

        <h3>Download and try it</h3>
        <p>Download Agile Toolkit from <a href="http://agiletoolkit.org">agiletoolkit.org</a> and unpack it into
        webroot. If you area already using webroot for something else, you can pick any other sub-directory. The
        file you just downloaded called atk4-example.zip combines 3 things: Agile Toolkit, Add-ons and a very
        simple example project structure.</p>

        <p>Open index.php file in your browser and you should see "Hello World from your own copy of Agile Toolkit".
        For your convenience, here is a sample installation on our server: <a href="http://example.agiletoolkit.org/">
        http://example.agiletoolkit.org/</a>

        If this works, then you are ready to proceed to the next step.

        <h3>Alternative Installation</h3>

        <p>If you are using Linux, then you probably already have Apache installed. You can also use more complex
        configurations such as Nginx + PHP-FMP or lighttpd for improved performance.</p>

        <h3>Git</h3>
        <p>If you are well familiar with Git, you can "clone" atk4-example instead of downloading it. Alternatively
        you can create your own repository and attach atk4 and atk4-addons as submodules.</a>

<?Code?>
$ git clone git://github.com/atk4/atk4-example
$ cd atk4-example
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
<?/?>

        <h3>Deployment</h3>

        <p>Finally, if you are looking to share your web application with others, we suggest you to use Platform as
        a Service offering PHP hosting in the cloud. It will take care of your project deployment for you and will let
        you focus on development. Agile Toolkit is tested and should work with most PHP platforms. Two deployment platforms
        which we recommend are:
