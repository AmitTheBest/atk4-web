        <h1>Use with Git and Subversion</h1>
        <p>Source control system is an absolute necessity in modern software development. Depending on type of the project
        you might want to use either Git or Subversion. Agile Toolkit uses Git due to it's open-source nature. If you are
        willing to add changes to Agile Toolkit, you can <a href="http://github.com/atk4/atk4/">fork it on GitHub.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Git introduction</h3>
        <p>If you are willing to use most up-to-date copy of Agile Toolkit, then you would need to use "git". Git is a
        command-line utility which is executed as "git command arguments ..'. A good starting guide on Git is: <a
        href="http://book.git-scm.com/">http://book.git-scm.com</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/atk4/atk4">https://github.com/atk4/atk4</a> is GitHub page for Agile Toolkit. You will
        find "branch" switch as well as selection for tags. There are two major branches: "devel" and "master". All the
        stable releases are based on "master" branch and beta releases are based on "devel" branch. Sometimes new feature
        branches will appear as experimental features are being developed.</p>

        <p>Documentation on this site applies to 4.1 branch (or later where specified). Throughout the code improvements
        some functions might be renamed. A backwards compatibility is maintained throughout one major release, for instance
        migrating 4.0 code to 4.1 might work well, but migrating to 4.2 might require you to change calls to some obsolete
        functions. Some older classes may be removed and placed under "atk4-obsolete" repository. If your code relies on
        them, copy them into local lib or use addLocation.</p>

        <h3>Share your project</h3>
        <p>If you are developing non-commercial project with Agile Toolkit under AGPL license, we invite you to share this
        project on GitHub.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open <a href="http://github.com/">github.com</a>, login and create new repository. Follow instruction.</li>
        <li>Remove atk4 / atk4-addons if you have downloaded them through ZIP</li>
        <li>Checkout atk4 and atk4-addons directly through Git<br/>
<?Code?>
$ git submodule add git@github.com:atk4/atk4.git
$ git submodule add git@github.com:atk4/atk4-addons.git
$ git submodule update
<?/?>
        </li>
        <li>If you need development branch:<br/>
<?Code?>
$ cd atk4
$ git checkout devel
$ cd ..

$ cd atk4-addons
$ git checkout devel
$ cd ..
<?/?>
        </li>
        <li>use "git status" and create your own .gitignore files. Add "config.php", ".htaccess" and other files which you do
        not wish to share in there.
<?MoreInfo?>Why placing config.php and .htaccess into Git / SVN is bad?
<p>Config file contains server-specific configuration. It might be private keys, or mysql password or some other sensetive information. Adding this information into Git may expose it on-line or to people who woludn't normally have access to the server. </p>
<p>File ".htaccess" might be OK for adding, although if you have some server-specific configuration in there, the same principle may apply.
