        <h1>Authentication and Authorization</h1>
        <p>Different web applications will employ different authorization and authentication strategies. Such as in some
        cases access to the application is restricted unless user enters password. In other case users can interact with most
        of the functions, however gain additional privileges if authenticated.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit provides a basic implementation for authentication and supports white-list and black-list
        strategies.</p>

<?MoreInfo?>Terminology explanation
<ul>
<li>Authentication — a process where user enters his username and password or uses some other means for authentication, such as OpenID</li>
<li>Authorization — defining type of operations which current user can or cannot do.</li>
<li>white-list — scenario when all actions/pages are restricted unless specifically allowed. White-list is considered more secure over black-list.</li>
<li>black-list - a manual check on restricted pages to not allow user access.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Using BasicAuth class</h3>
        <p>Controller BasicAuth is a simple implementation of Authentication class. Below is a sample use from inside API
        class:</p>
<?Code?>
$this->add('BasicAuth')->allow('john','secret')->allow('peter','shoeshine')->check();
<?/Code?>

        <p>The above code will add BasicAuth into API, manually allow 2 users to have access then perform the check. You will
        see a login form when accessing any page handled by this API. Class SQLAuth can be used if you wish to authenticate
        users against the database.</p>
<?Code?>
$this->add('SQLAuth')->setSource('user','login','password')->useEncryption('sha1')->check();
<?/Code?>

        <h3>Implementing white-list</h3>
        <p>Both black-list and white-list implementation rely on executing or bypassing "check" method. If check is not
        executed, then authentication is not required. However if user is logged in already, then even without calling
        check() his login information is preserved.</p>

<?Code?>
$this->add('SQLAuth');     // automatically sets $api->auth to self
$this->auth->allowPage('privcay');
$this->auth->allowPage(array('faq','contact','about'));
$this->auth->setSource('user','login','password');
$this->auth->useEncryption('sha1');
if($this->auth->isPageAllowed($this->page)){
    $this->auth->check();
}
<?/Code?>

        <h3>Implementing black-list</h3>
        <p>To keep non-authenticated users away from some pages you should move call to $api->check() inside those pages.</p>

<?Code?>
// inside page/secret.php, method init()

$this->api->auth->check();
$this->add('Text')->set('Hello user with id=',$this->api->auth->get('id'));
<?/Code?>

        <h3>Enhancing authentication query</h3>
        <p>Like explained on previous page, you can enhance your authentication query by interacting $auth->dq object between
        adding of SQLAuth object and check(). Calling setSource will return newly created DSQL object for your convenience.

<?Code?>
$this->add('SQLAuth')
    ->setSource('user','login','password')
    ->join('user_role ur','ur.user_id=user.id')
    ->where('ur.type','admin')
    ->field('last_login, name');

if($this->auth->check()){
    // Executed only first tame when user has authenticated.

    $this->js(true)->univ()->successMessage('Welcome back, '.
            $this->auth->get('name').' your previous login was on '.
            $this->auth->get('last_login')
            );

    $this->auth->dq->set('last_login',date('Y-m-d'))->do_update();
}
<?/Code?>
