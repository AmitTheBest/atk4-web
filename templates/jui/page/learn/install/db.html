        <h1>Database</h1>
        <p>Agile Toolkit focuses on tight integration with MySQL database. Although there are no artificial
        restrictions, development team decided to focus on a single database engine. This might be seen as
        an advantage or as a disadvantage.</p>

        <p>MySQL is clearly the most successful companion for PHP applications and provides all the features
        a typical Web application would use. You can still use Agile Toolkit with other databases on your own
        risk.</p>

        <h3>Establishing connection</h3>
        <p>To establish connection with the database you should add the following command either on the API's init()
        method or inside page's init() method.</p>
<?Code?>
$this->api->dbConnect();
<?/Code?>
        <p>Establishing connection and selecting database takes some time, so if your application is not database-intensive
        then placing this statement into certain pages or even certain views might be a good idea.</p>

        <p>Even if called several times, database connection will be establised only once. Therefore if you need a testing
        suite with a different database connection, you can issue this manually:</p>
<?Code?>
$this->api->dbConnect($this->api->getConfig('dsn_testing'));
<?/Code?>

        <h3>SQL Access from Views</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit was one of the first web framework to implement dynamic queries in 2003. DSQL is a very
        imporant component of Agile Toolkit as is used by many View objects. In contrast, views from other frameworks rely on
        ORM directly to perform operations introducing data-layer abstraction in this way.</p>

        <p>To explain this in simple terms, I will use Form class as example. You can use $form->setSource('table'); on the
        form which will make it fetch field data from database.</p>
<?Code?>
$form=$page->add('Form');
$form->addField('line','name');
$form->addField('line','surname');
$form->setSource('user');
$form->setCondition('id',123);
<?/Code?>
        
        <p>Views can cary their own DSQL object, which they use in certain ways. Usually it's accessible through $object->dq
        and you can manipulate it. It is actually what "Models" do in Agile Toolkit. When used with Form, they would
        initialize fields for you and manipulate Form's DSQL as per configuration of the model.</p>

        <p>If you wish to use one object with a different database for the purpose of dependency-injection, you should
        manually create $object->dq.</p>

        <h3>Debugging database queries</h3>
        <p>To make any DSQL object expose it's queries execute debug() method:</p>
<?Code?>
$form->dq->debug();
<?/?>
        <p>This would output queries on the screen. A properly-written View will not perform any queries in it's init()
        method, but will perform them during rendering phase.</p>
