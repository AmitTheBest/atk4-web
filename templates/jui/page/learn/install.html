        <h3>Developer Requirements</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit makes web development easier then plain PHP development. While other frameworks introduce many
        new concepts on top of already many things PHP developers must know, Agile Toolkit focuses on simplifying
        developer's experience. There are only 2 things you must know when you are starting with Agile Toolkit:
        <ul>
        <li>Basic Syntax of PHP Language — you should know how to work with variables, execute functions an methods.</li>
        <li>Understanding of Object Oriented programming — it is very important that you know how to work with Objects.</li>

        <h3>atk4-example versus atk4</h3>
        <p>All information related to Agile Toolkit resides in the folder "atk4". Agile Toolkit does not come with a
        command-line scripts for PHP file generation. You, the developer, will be writing those PHP files. Agile Toolkit
        opposes code generation and instead makes it very easy and quick to write code which works efficiently and just
        the way you want.</p>

        <p>As a result, you must understand - code for Agile Toolkit is in folder "atk4". All YOUR code is outside that
        folder. You can have "atk4" folder in other location, share it with different projects, delete it and replace with
        newer version of Agile Toolkit at any time.</p>
        

        <h3>Configuring Agile Toolkit</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit works out of the box, no configuration. You will need configuration as you progress, but initially
        you can just let it run as it is.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to develop a serious application, then MySQL is essential. Agile Toolkit does not presently work
        with other SQL databases.</p>

        <h3>Source Code Versioning (Git)</h3>
        <p>As you write more and more code, it's always nice to have archive of your changes. When you are working in
        a team with multiple people, you would want to share code without fear of overwiting someone's modification. That's
        what "Version Control System" are doing. Subversion and Git are probably the most popular ones.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit development is also controlled through Version Control System. It used to be developed in Subversion
        but has migrated to Git. We recommend you to learn about how to use either Git or Subversion early on and keep
        using it.</p>

        Documentation for Agile Toolkit is organized into a tree-like structure for better navigation. There are 3 main
        sections of documentation: Introduction, Learning and Reference. You can always see where you are by looking at
        the bread-crumb bar on the top of any documentation page. For example, now you are in the "Learning" section</p>

        <h3>Intro &rarr; Learn &rarr; Reference</h3>
        <p>When you have first come to <a href="/">AgileToolkit.org</a> your first impression from the "Introduction
        Section". Introduction is designed to give you basic idea about Agile Toolkit.</p>

        <p>Learning section is where you are right now. It is structured to guide you through all the concepts of Agile
        Toolkit in order of importance.</p>

        <p>Finally, as you become more experienced with Agile Toolkit, you would be most interested in a Reference section of
        documentation. Reference will help you to get the most out of Agile Toolkit.</p>


        <p>Agile Toolkit is about results. It is about development of Web software. Specifically a dynamic, customizable and
        flexible Web Interface with a extensive and separated Business Logic. Agile Toolkit gives you, a developer, a faster
        ride.</p>

        <p>It's impossible to copy concepts of other general PHP frameworks and make web development faster. That's why Agile
        Toolkit is different. It's easier to understand, easier to write. It takes care of things and all the components
        integrate seamlessly.</p>

        <p>Developing with Agile Toolkit is the following of concepts of Agile Toolkit. If you are uncomfortable with those
        concepts, we suggest to use general-purpose framework. General purpose frameworks give choices, Agile Toolkit makes
        choices</p>
