        <h3>Developer Requirements</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit makes web development easier then plain PHP development. While other frameworks introduce many
        new concepts on top of already many things PHP developers must know, Agile Toolkit focuses on simplifying
        developer's experience. There are only 2 things you must know when you are starting with Agile Toolkit:
        <ul>
        <li>Basic Syntax of PHP Language — you should know how to work with variables, execute functions an methods.</li>
        <li>Understanding of Object Oriented programming — it is very important that you know how to work with Objects.</li>
