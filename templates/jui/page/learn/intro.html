        <h1>Why Object Oriented Web Programming is more powerful than conventional MVC?</h1>

        <p><b>OOP</b> is one of the major concepts in the world of Computing. For decades Object Oriented Programming has been used in all environments - on computer desktop, on mobile devices. Some web frameworks have been using it.</p>

        <p>You might say now - "I'm using MVC, so I am using OOP!". The truth is, even though most of the PHP Web Frameworks claim to be Object-Oriented, that does not imply that the developers using them are producing a well thought-out Object Oriented Code.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit implements a solid Object-Oriented core framework, which you extend in your software. It might require you to learn some new ways, but it's a step into the right direction. If you have recently learned some of the frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, the Agile Toolkit will be a significant step forward. After all — Agile Toolkit takes web development to a whole new level with it's integrated User Interface.</p>

        <?MoreInfo?>What is Wrong With Existing MVC Frameworks?
        <p>Similarly to the development of static web sites, most MVC frameworks are page-oriented. You've got one controller per page and most likely one model/template per page. They wouldn't attempt to abstract any of the technologies they rely on such as HTML, JavaScript, Templates, jQuery and they make no efforts to be flexible when it comes to add-ons or re-use of your own code across multiple projects.</p>

        <p>Those limitations are the consequences of their decisions to use very simple Object-Oriented. For example, Views are often PHP files containing HTML or Logic-infused templates which can't be extended, Models could be technically extended, but there are no benefit in doing that.</p>

        <p>Your product would most likely have one controller per page, one model per SQL table and a LOT of HTML code duplication in your views.</p>
<?/?>
<?MoreInfo?>Need More info about Object-Oriented Programming?
<p>Objects are part of our real life. Take a car, for example. A car is an object. It has properties, such as color, model, year. There are things you can do with a car: drive, wash, lock and unlock it.</p>

<p>The goal of Object Oriented Programming is to discover self-sufficient objects in the software, and describe them using classes. The behaviour and the properties of the button are described in the Button class.</p>

<p>Properly constructed Object-oriented architecture hides the complexity of things, while still allowing a developer to be in control of the behaviour. With the great Object-oriented capabilities introduced to PHP since PHP5, web applications based on PHP can also be very object-oriented.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit implements a general object-oriented architecture, as well as large amount of base classes. You can use the classes you like, and build upon them. Programming with Agile Toolkit is like building a sky-scraper: you build upon the foundation. You re-use, extend, enhance the basic building blocks.</p>

<h2>Agile Toolkit Core Concepts</h2>

        <h3>The "View" class</h3>
<div style="float: right">
<?Execute?>
$page->add('Button')->set('This is a "Button" View');
<?/?>
</div>

<p>The first fundamental concept of Agile Toolkit are <b>the "View" classes</b>. If you have been developing on GUI libraries, you know what it is.</p>

<p>The button you see on the right is instance of the class "Button". It takes just one line of code to add a button anywhere on your page. The Button object then takes care of rendering itself, handling events, using jQuery UI's widget. This ability of object to do what's necessary is called <b>"abstraction"</b>.

<p>Agile Toolkit has LOTS of view classes for you to use, but if you need to have your own class, you can easily create it. You can override template for any view to specify your own HTML-template, so adding your custom pieces of HTML code is as easy as typing it's filename.</p>

        <h3>The "Render Tree"</h3>
<?Execute?>
$frame = $page->add('HtmlElement')->addStyle('border','1px dashed red')->addStyle('padding','5px');
$frame = $frame->add('HtmlElement')->addStyle('border','1px dashed green')->addStyle('padding','5px');
$frame->add('Button')->set('Same Button Class');
<?/?>

<p>Inside your application you <b>add</b> objects into other objects. Above you see that the exactly same button is not added into the "HtmlElement" class with a custom border, which is placed inside yet another HtmlElement. The recursive rendering is done automatically by Agile Toolkit, so your job as developer is to put projects into the right places and configure them to use right styles and have proper labels.</p>

<h3>The "Model" Class</h3>
<?Code?>
$page->add('FormAndSave')->setModel('Person')->load($person_id);
<?/?>

<p>The next fundamental concept is the Model Class. Model describes your data entity including fields, labels, validation rules, custom actions, hints and more. With an easy syntax you can associate "Model" object with the "View" object. This connections makes use of an appropriate "Controller" which job is to "configure" the view for the Model.</p>

<p>You can mix and match. FormAndSave view is a descendant of a "Form" class which automatically adds an "Update" button and allows you to save data into the database.</p>

<h3>The "Controller" Class</h3>
<?Code?>
$model->add('Controller_Encrypt')->useField('account_number')->useEncryption('rsa');
<?/?>

<?Code?>
$api->add('Controller_PatternRouter')
  ->addRule("profile/(.*)", "profile/details", array("profile_id"))	
  ->addRule("blog/([0-9]*)-.*", "blog/item", array("id"))	
  ->route();
<?/?>

<p>Controllers in Agile Toolkit are classes which "Enrich" the functionality of existing objects. The "Controller_Encrypt" adds ability into a "Model" to use strong encryption on some of the fields. The PatternRouter controller adds pattern matching and PHP-based rewrites.</p>

<p>Controllers are used when you connect to database, associate view with model, use pagination on the form, add "strength" indicator into the password field or add anti-XSF tokens into the form class.</p>

<h3>The "Application" Class</h3>
<p>Application class is designed so that you can create Your Own Toolkit. In this new application you might pre-initialize the controllers you want and include the add-ons you would most probably use. Finally you will be able to throw your snippets away and turn them into on-demand classes.</p>

<h3>The "Agile Store"</h3>
<p>Given the powerful architecture of Agile Toolkit, many different extensions, templates, models and the whole UI pages. The "Agile Store" which is introduced in 4.2 of Agile Toolkit is the way of us saying - "Got a nice piece of code? Share and perhaps even make some money on it!". Or if you are looking for a good quality add-on, why purchase it from someone for the price of a "Frappuchino".</p>

<p>Some examples of what you can find in the store are: "Comment Anywhere" - plug-in you can put on any page which enables users to comment on anything, "ModelAudit" - controller to make your models auditable (records editing operations into separate table) and also brings the views for you to look at the audit history. "Countries" - delivers model containing up-to-date list of countries. "Job Queue" - a system for implementing your own Cloud-Powered Job Processing queues based on SQL or SQS. Many others too.</p>


<h3>Agile Toolkit based Projects</h3>
<p>There are commercial and open-source projects which build end-user focused software on Agile Toolkit: Content Management Systems, CRMs, Ticket/Support systems, Task management systems, eCommerce solutions. Since they do share the same foundation you can use any of the plug-ins from the store on those products too.</p>

<p>If you are building an Agile-Toolkit based project, be sure to list it on Agile Toolkit website.</p>

        <h2>Fives types of objects in Agile Toolkit</h2>

        <p>I have only mentioned "Visual" objects, or views. There are actually 5 object types in Agile
        Toolkit, and they are described below.
        </p>

        <h3>Application (API)</h3>


        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop1.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>In simple terms, an Application (web application) helps the user manage server-side data. For each request made by the user, the web application needs to collect information from the data storage, and produce a response to the user.</p>

        <h3>Pages</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop3.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>A Page is a page. That's what we see when we open a book. It's also what we see when we open a website. On a website
        we navigate between the pages using hyperlinks. The pages in a website can look very different from each other, but they can also share many common components, such as a navigation menu, the general layout of the site, or the general 'look' (style) of the site.
     </p>

        <p>It makes sense to build a page using an object-oriented approach. This way one page may easily 'inherit' another. For example:
        you might have a generic 'signup' page, and easily develop a 'registration' page which will 'inherit' the functionality of the signup, and extend it - like in our example.</p>

        <p>In Agile Toolkit — Pages define UI logic. Often a skilled designer can understand the code in Page definitions, and even change
        some of the PHP code themselves. It's essential to separate UI logic from business logic, which is defined in Models.</p>

        <h3>Models</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop6.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Models are objects mimicking real-world objects. Depending on your application, you will define different types of models. For instance: for a job site, you may have JobApplication, User and other similar objects.</p>

        <p>Again, the object-oriented approach makes a lot of sense for modelling your application classes. If you have different
        user types, they would extend the same parent class.</p>

        <p>Some plug-ins may include some generic models. For instance there is a model for "Country", along with a database table
        with content for the model. It contains the official list of ISO countries and codes. Including such a model can save you development
        time and help you update your application when the country list is updated or changed.</p>

        <h3>Views</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop5.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Views are Widgets. While widgets in many frameworks are programmed using procedures and functions, the Views in Agile Toolkit are also implemented using Object-Oriented design: as classes. One View can inherit another View, or it can contain other views within itself.</p>

        <p>Procedural widgets are aimed at end-users. You, as developer, can understand the benefit of an object-oriented approach
        better. That's why views in Agile Toolkit are not designed to serve all purposes, instead they are designed to
        be simply extended and tweaked, to work the way you need.

        <h3>Controllers</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop4.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Your application needs a lot of functionality. Some of it will help you deal with specific problems, such as template
        parsing, or database access.</p>

        <p>Controllers in Agile Toolkit enhance functionality of their parent object. Controller may enhance the way
        errors are displayed, the way audit is done on your models, or how pagination works in your grid.</p>

        <p>As controllers often have common functionality, object-oriented architecture can help us out here. For instance: you could have
        different authorization mechanisms - different authorization controllers - based on a generic authorization class.</p>

        <h2>What is Abstraction?</h2>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop2.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>The Button object is designed to do one thing only: implement a button. The Form object, on the other hand, is meant to implement forms. It may, however, rely on a Button in order to do its job.</p>

        <p>Going further up, a Page object's job is to implement a single page. The Page relies on objects such as Forms, Buttons blocks of text and so on. Finally the top-most object - which relies on Pages, Authentication, Database connectivity, many other objects, and which is meant to implement your whole web application - is the Application object.</p>

        <p>All of the objects have a few qualities in common. They rely on each other to do their job. They hide the complexity of their implementation behind their interfaces.</p>

        <p>As a good and efficient developer, your job is to understand the importance of abstraction, and to be able to
        implement additional objects to fit in their proper roles. Objects must always take advantage of other objects
        if possible, and each object must be simple to use.</p>

        <h2>Moving forward</h2>
        <p>To learn Agile Toolkit, you need to first understand the concept of Applications and PMVC (Page, Model, View,
                Controller). You don't have to understand in detail how each of these objects work right away, but as you learn how each one works, and how they fit in with each other, you'll gradually understand and appreciate the structure of the framework as a whole.</p>

        <p>The approach we take in the Learning chapter will focus on one thing at a time. However, the first thing is to get
        your own copy of Agile Toolkit, so you can try things out. If you do not wish to install Agile Toolkit yet,
        you can <a href="<?page?>learn/understand<?/?>">skip the installation part</a>.
