        <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>

        <p>OOP is one of the major concepts in the world of Computing. The general idea of Object-oriented programming is
        that you operate not with just chunks of data, but with objects. Objects consist of some structured data as well as
        methods you can execute. Object would most likely describe a real objects around us such as User, Requests, Paymetns
        and so on.</p>

        <p>Objects are defined through a "class" which describes from which other object it derives and how it differs from
        it's predcessor.</p>

        <p>PHP Language starting from version 5 has became a fully-featured platform for Object Oriented programming.
        Unfortunatelly the software for various reasons (historical and performance) wouldn't take advantage of Object
        Oriented programming.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit implements Web Application in the way how it should be from a proper object-oriented architectural
        design. However before going into technical details, let's review what it is we are looking to build</p>

        <h2>Components of Web Application</h2>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop1.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>In simple terms, web application helps user manage server-side data. For each request by the user, web application
        needs to collect information from the data storage and produce respons to that user.</p>

        <p>Logically web applicaion can be separated from 4 type of components: pages, models, views and controllers.</p>

        <h3>Pages</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop3.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Page is a page. That's what we see when we open a book. It's also what we see when we open a website. On a websate
        we navigate between the pages. Pages would be different, although they may share common components such as grids or
        forms.</p>

        <p>It makes sense to build page through object oriented approach. This way one page may inherit another. For example
        you might have a generic signup page which is further extended by similar registration form for different
        scenarios, like in our example.</p>

        <p>In Agile Toolkit — Pages define UI logic</p>

        <h3>Models</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop4.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Models are objects mimicking a real-world objects. Depending on your application, models will be defined
        differently. For instance for job site you may have JobApplication, User and similar other objects.</p>

        <p>Again, object-oriented approach makes a lot of sense for modeling your application classes. If you have different
        user types, they would extend same anchestor class.</p>

        <h3>Views</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop5.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Views are Widgets. Except that the View is also implemented in Object-Oriented design - as a class. One View can
        inherit another View or it can contains some other views within itself.</p>

        <p>Unlike widgets which are oriented at end-users, you, as developer, understand benefit of object-oriented approach
        much better. That's why views in Agile Toolkit are not designed to serve all purposes, instead they are designed to
        be simply extended and tweaked the way you need.

        <h3>Controllers</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop6.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Your application needs a lot of functionality. Some would help you deal with specific problems such as template
        parsing or database access.</p>

        <p>Controllers in Agile Toolkit enhance functionality of their parent object. Controller may enhance the way how
        errors are displayed, how audit is done on your models or how pagination works in your grid.</p>

        <p>As controllers often have common things, object-oriented architecture helps here out. For instance you could have
        different authorization mechanisms based on generic authorization class.</p>

        <h2>Application — The Glue</h2>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop2.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Agile Toolkit is different from frameworks because each of the objects above are capable of automatically interact
        with each-other. For example when you add View on the page and bind it with Model, it will automatically figure out
        which controllers to load and how to manipulate data or draw itself.</p>

        <p>Simple design of adding objects ultimatelly carries dependencies through the Application. Object will referr to
        application's default DB manager when trying to do data loading.</p>

        <p>As developer, however, you may create multiple applications at the same time and this way define full environment
        for the objects you are going to use.</p>

        <h2>Moving forward</h2>
        <p>To learn agile toolkit, you need to first understand the concept of APMVC (Application, Page, Model, View,
                Controller).</p>

        <p>Further learning course will be focused on getting working examples first, then tweaking.</p>
