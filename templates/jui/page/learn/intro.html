        <h1>Object Oriented Web Programming</h1>

        <p><b>OOP</b> is one of the major concepts in the world of Computing. For decades Object Oriented Programming was used in all environments.</p>

        <p>Web Programming, however, was initially design-driven. Scripting was supposed only to fill the gaps in static HTML files.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit introduces the "Real" object-oriented web development. The principle of "abstraction" and "black boxes" is applied on all parts of web development - Models, Views, Controllers, Pages and Applications itself.</p>

        <h2>What are Web Objects?</h2>
<div style="float: right">
<?Execute?>
$page->add('Button')->set('This is object');
<?/?>
</div>
        <p>Observe the button on the right. To your browser it's a sequence of HTML code. However for developer in Agile Toolkit, the button is the object. Developer may not want to know, how button presents itself, how it reacts to events or how it's communicating with the database. Like many other things around it — button is yet another object.</p>

        <p>Without thinking too much about "<b>how?</b>" a developer can now focus on "<b>what?</b>".

<p>Objects is our real life. Take a car for example. Car is an object. It has properties such as color, model, year. There are things you can do with a car - drive, wash, lock and unlock.</p>

<p>The goal of Object Oriented Programming is to discover a self-sufficient objects in the software and describe them using classes. Behaviour and properties of the button are described in the Button's class.</p>

<p>Properly constructed Object-oriented architecture hides the complexity of things while still allowing a developer to be in control of the behaviour. With the great Object-oriented capabilities since PHP5 web applications can also become very object-oriented.</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit implements the general architecture as well as large amount of base classes. You can use the classes you like and build upon them. Programming with Agile Toolkit is like building a sky-scraper. You re-use, extend, enhance. You build upon the foundation, not merely use it as a code-generator.</p>

<h2>Object-Oriented universe of Agile Toolkit</h2>
        <p>When Object Oriented Design is applied to Web Development it abstracts the way how you operate with Web Objects
        such as forms, buttons, pages, links and other. Instead of writing HTML, CSS ad JavaScript code you now interact with
        a native object in PHP.</p>

        <p>The button example demonstrates just one object in Agile Toolkit. A more complex objects can
        implement forms, signup wizards, payment forms, file manager, polls, comment feed an so on. Regardless of which object
        you are using, it's straightforward and simple.</p>

        <p>When developing with Agile Toolkit, you will design your objects too. Primarily you would need to deal with two types of objects: <b>Models</b> and <b>Pages</b>. However, there are five major object types in Agile Toolkit.

        <h2>Fives types of objects in Agile Toolkit</h2>

        <p>I have only mentioned "Visual" objects or views. There are actually 5 objects types in Agile
        Toolkit and they are described below.
        </p>

        <h3>Application (API)</h3>


        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop1.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>In simple terms, web application helps user manage server-side data. For each request by the user, web application
        needs to collect information from the data storage and produce response to that user.</p>

        <h3>Pages</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop3.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Page is a page. That's what we see when we open a book. It's also what we see when we open a website. On a websate
        we navigate between the pages. Pages can be different, but can also share common components such as look or layout.
     </p>

        <p>It makes sense to build page through object oriented approach. This way one page may inherit another. For example
        you might have a generic signup page which is further extended by similar registration form for different
        scenarios, like in our example.</p>

        <p>In Agile Toolkit — Pages define UI logic. Often skilled designer could understand Page definitions or even change
        some of the PHP code. It's essential to separate UI logic from business logic, which is defined in Models.</p>

        <h3>Models</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop6.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Models are objects mimicking a real-world objects. Depending on your application, models will be defined
        differently. For instance for job site you may have JobApplication, User and similar other objects.</p>

        <p>Again, object-oriented approach makes a lot of sense for modeling your application classes. If you have different
        user types, they would extend same parent class.</p>

        <p>Some plug-ins may include some generic models. For instance there is model for "Country" along with database table
        with content. It contains official list of ISO countries and codes. Including such a model can save you development
        time and help you update your application when country list is updated or changed.</p>

        <h3>Views</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop5.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Views are Widgets. Except that the View is also implemented in Object-Oriented design - as a class. One View can
        inherit another View or it can contains some other views within itself.</p>

        <p>Unlike widgets which are oriented at end-users, you, as developer, understand benefit of object-oriented approach
        much better. That's why views in Agile Toolkit are not designed to serve all purposes, instead they are designed to
        be simply extended and tweaked the way you need.

        <h3>Controllers</h3>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop4.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Your application needs a lot of functionality. Some would help you deal with specific problems such as template
        parsing or database access.</p>

        <p>Controllers in Agile Toolkit enhance functionality of their parent object. Controller may enhance the way how
        errors are displayed, how audit is done on your models or how pagination works in your grid.</p>

        <p>As controllers often have common things, object-oriented architecture helps here out. For instance you could have
        different authorization mechanisms based on generic authorization class.</p>

        <h2>What is Abstraction?</h2>

        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/oop2.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Back to our early example of a button object. The Button object is designed to do one thing only — implement a button. Form object on other hand is meant to implement forms. It may also rely on Button to do it's job.</p>

        <p>Going further up, a Page object's job is to implement a single page. Page relies on objects such as Forms, Buttons blocks of text and so on. Finally the top-most object, which relies on Pages, Authentication, Database connectivity and other objects and which is meant to implement your whole web application is the Application object.</p>

        <p>All of the objects have few qualities in common. They rely on each-other to do their job. They hide complexity of it's implementation in their own interface.</p>

        <p>As a good and efficient developer, your job is to understand the importance of abstraction and be able to
        implement additional objects to fit in their proper roles. Objects must always take advantages of other objects
        if possible and each object must be simple to use.</p>

        <h2>Moving forward</h2>
        <p>To learn Agile Toolkit, you need to first understand this concept of Applications and PMVC (Page, Model, View,
                Controller). You don't have to learn in detail how each of them work right away, but you'll gradually
        learn to understand and appreciate the structure.</p>

        <p>The approach we take in the Learning chapter will focus at one thing at a time. However, first thing is to get
        your own copy of Agile Toolkit where you can try things out. If you do not wish to install Agile Toolkit yet,
        you can <a href="<?page?>learn/understand<?/?>">skip the installation part</a>.
