        <h1>API Classes</h1>
        <h3>The Purpose</h3>
        <p>API (Application Programmable Interface) is the main class responsible for delegating tasks. This class decides, which modules to load, which routing to use, how to handle authentication and many other things.
        </p>
        <p>To put it simple - API class is responsible for reading input data and producing output.</p>

        <h3>How to use?</h3>
        <p>Your web software may have multiple application classes - frotnend, back-end, REST API, cron, command-line etc. Your API classes will extend on some API classes already provided by Agile Toolkit: ApiFrontend, ApiCLI or ApiWeb.</p>
