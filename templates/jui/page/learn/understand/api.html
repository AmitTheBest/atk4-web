        <h1>API Classes</h1>
        <p>API (Application Programmable Interface) is a central class of Agile Toolkit which holds all the application
        together. Because Agile Toolkit is not limited to only one type of web application, it comes with the range of APIs
        and you can pick the one which suits your needs best.</p>

        <p>As you develop your application, you also developing your own API class. This is a natural start for some of the
        amazing extending features. For example you can create your own API class and extend it in all of your applications.
        That's a really powerful way to make Agile Toolkit "fit your needs"</p>
