        <h1>Adding Pages</h1>

        <p>Agile Toolkit facilitates several ways to define new pages. Depending on your situation you should choose the most
        appropriate way.</p>

        <p>The way how pages are located are defined by the API used. For example for command-line (ApiCLI) concept of pages
        is not defined at all. Table below shows the behaviour of ApiFrontend based page routing.</p>

<div class="box blue-noised p-10px">
	<div class="white">
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Defined in</th>
					<th>Class used</th>
					<th>Template used</th>
					<th width="50%">Notes</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>API Method</td>
				<td>Page</td>
                <td>Default</td>
				<td>Probably the fastest way to create page handler is to define function inside API class. Function starts
                with prefix "page_" and continues with the page name with slashes replaced into underscores. Try to avoid
                using this method.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>File page/mypage.php</td>
				<td>custom</td>
                <td>default or custom</td>
				<td>This is preferred way to define new pages if you need dynamic content on them and optionally custom
                layout.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Template Only</td>
				<td>Page</td>
                <td>custom</td>
				<td>Ideal for custom pages. Simply create a single file with no PHP in it</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Your own</td>
				<td>Custom</td>
                <td>Custom</td>
				<td>Implement your own pattern in the API class. You can use this method to fetch pages from data-base or
                generate them dynamically</td>
			</tr>

        <h3>Defining new pages through API methods</h3>
<?Code?>
function page_helloworld($page){
    $page->add('Button')->setLabel('Click Me');
}
<?/?>
        <p>This is possibly the fastest way to add a new page to your Agile Toolkit application. API will automatically
        create a standard page for you and will pass it to the function as an argument. You then can add objects into the
        page.
