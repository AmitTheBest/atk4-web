        <h1>How Agile Toolkit translates URL into Page</h1>
        <p>In Agile Toolkit, pages are handled by a special objects instantiated from Page class. Any page has a name to
        which it will respond. Usually one page object is automatically initialized by the API along with all the objects
        on that page.</p>

        <p>You might have noticed, how we were adding objects in the previous chapter into $page. This variable refers to a
        current page object. In reality, you most probably would be putting the code directly into page/index.php which
        defines class page_index and any objects you want to see on this page should be added inside init() method.</p>

        <p>By it's nature Page object is also derived from AbstractView. All you need to do is define page classes. Do not
        manually add page objects,
        API will do it for you. But how does API knows which page class to use?</p>

        <h3>Page Routing</h3>
        <p>By default, Agile Toolkit is using front-controller approach. All the requests are being captured and executed
        in the same way, through mod_rewrite and through index.php which creates and executes API. API relies on a specific
        component called PageManager. The job of PageManager is to determine name of the Page Class from the used URL.</p>

        <p>The actual logic is always quite intuitive. Look at the following page for examples:</p>
<div class="box blue-noised p-10px">
	<div class="white">
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Browser URL</th>
					<th>Page</th>
					<th width="50%">Notes</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/preferences.html</td>
				<td>preferences</td>
				<td>Agile Toolkit completely ignores the extension and uses remaining location to determine page name.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/index.php?page=user/add</td>
				<td>user/add</td>
				<td>Your default install of Agile Toolkit is not configured to use mod_rewrite. Therefore URL in browser will
                appear to have index.php in front of it. Passing page=XX will always override page name, which is very useful
                in in building beautiful URLs</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/profile/change-password.do</td>
				<td>profile/changepassword</td>
				<td>Dashes cannot be used in a function or class, they are eliminated from the page name automatically. Any
                extension can be used as long as .htaccess directs them into index.php</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/?abc=123</td>
				<td>index</td>
				<td>If URL does not contain page, then "index" page name is used.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>http://example.com/admin/logout</td>
				<td>logout</td>
				<td>Most often site administration is implemented as a separate site with it's other entry point. Pages are
                relative to installation point.</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

        <h3>URL Components</h3>

        <p>PageManager splits URL from your location bar into 3 parts:

        <ol><li>base_url</li>
        <li>base_path</li>
        <li>page</li></ol>
       
        $api->pm->base_url points at the web-server of your
        web application, such as http://yoursite.com:81. Next part is $api->pm->base_path is pointing to the root page of
        your web software. For example, if you un-pack software under webroot/test/app then
        base_path="/test/app/". base_path always starts and ends with slash.</p>

        <p>Final part is called "page" and it's relative location within your web application. The top-most page is called
        "index" page. The page you are looking at right now is called "learn/understand/page" and is calculated from the url:
        <?page?>.<?/?>.</p>

        <p>Page follows standard pattern, and executes init() method after it's initialized. Page may have a custom template,
        but if it does not, default page layout is used to display empty page.</p>
