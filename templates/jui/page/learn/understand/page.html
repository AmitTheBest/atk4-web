        <h1>Pages, Objects and Links</h1>
        <p>Web is greatly inspired by books. Similarly to book, the most fundamental part of the web is "a page". Page is
        collection of related objects and links. Links would usually lead to other pages, while objects may dynamically
        interact with user while he remains on the same page.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit relies on the similar concepts. Ultimately your project will consist of pages and each page would
        consist of static information, links and objects.</p>
