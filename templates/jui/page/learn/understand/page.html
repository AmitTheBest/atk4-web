        <h1>Pages, Objects and Links</h1>
        <p>Web is greatly inspired by books. Similarly to book, the most fundamental part of the web is "a page". Page is
        collection of related objects and links. Links would usually lead to other pages, while objects may dynamically
        interact with user while he remains on the same page.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit relies on the similar concepts. Ultimately your project will consist of pages and each page would
        consist of static information, links and objects. Let's look closely how Pages are implemented in Agile Toolkit:</p>



        <h2>Adding new page</h2>

        <p>Create a new file inside page/ called mypage.php. Inside there, create a class "page_mypage" extending "Page"
        class and defining init() method. Call parent::init() then add some objects using $this->add(); If you can't think of
        any interesting object to add, use LoremIpsum view.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit allows to create pages in few different ways - by defining template only, by defining class only, by
        defining both class and template or by defining none and setting up catch-all handler which might be useful if page
        content is coming from database.
