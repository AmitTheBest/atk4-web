        <h1>Calculated Fields</h1>
        <p>So far we have only defined init() method. However there are more fields to re-define. Here is our updated model class:</p>

<?Code?>
class Model_Book extends Model_Table {
    public $entity_code='book';
    public $table_alias='b';
    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $this->addField('name');
        $this->addField('isbn')->mandatory(true);
        $this->addField('publisher_id')->refModel('Publisher');
        $this->addField('author_id')->refModel('Author');

        $this->addField('copies_borrowed')->type('int')->calculated(true);
        $this->addField('copies_in_stock')->type('int')->calculated(true);
    }

    function calculate_copies_borrowed(){
        $dq=$this->add('Model_Book_Borrower')->dsql();
        $dq->where('bb.book_id = b.id');
        $dq->field('count(*)');
        return $dq;
    }

    function calculate_copies_in_stock(){
        $dq_total=$this->add('Model_Book_Stock')->dsql();
        $dq->where('bb.book_id = b.id');
        $dq->field('count(*)');

        return $dq.' - '.$this->calculate_copies_borrowed();
    }

}
<?/?>
        <p>Certainly a lot of magic here.</p>

        <h3>Building queries from models</h3>
        <p>Models can export dynamic query when you call $model->dsql(). This query will have a proper table and table aliass set but will also contain joins and conditions. It is essential that you rely on this method where possible. Once you will learn to use it efficiently, you will save yourself a lot of trouble.</p>

        <p>For example, consider that the model "Borrower" has changed the new flag is added "is_book_returned". Now instead of deleting the record condition must be used for this field. You would want to have this condition defined inside Model_Borrower::init() which will automatically be added to the query exported by dsql().</p>

        <p>As a result the count field will be properly and securely associated with only the right amount of borrowers</p>

        <h3>Combining queries</h3>
        <p>Dynamic qureies transform themselves into "select" when they are used in a string content. Our next function for calculating how many copies in stock needs to know how many copies we have in total, then substract the borrowed ones. As you can see, in a similar way we build sub-select for calculating total amount of books then substracting another calculated field from it.</p>

        <p>Again this is great for consistency of your business logic and is much better than writing your queries manually.</p>

        <h2>Using your own expressions in calculated fields</h2>
        <p>You can also manually provide any SQL for calculated fields:</p>
<?Code?>
function calculate_my_field(){
    return "other_field+2";
}
<?/?>
