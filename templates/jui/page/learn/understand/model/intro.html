<h1>Introduction to Models</h1>

<p>Models describe your real business entities in a very object-oriented way. Models implement Active Record functionality, as well as Dynamic Queries for multi-record actions. That means that Model will be your interface to Relational Database Management System such as (but not limited to) MySQL. You can also create non-relational models if you are using noSQL database.</p>

<?MoreInfo?>Why not use a 3rd party ORM?
<p>The design of Models in other ORMs such as Propel and Doctrine focuses mainly on cross-database implementation of SQL requests. The Models in Agile Toolkit focus on consistency of business logic and security features.</p>

<p>Other ORMs try to map database into a single class while Agile Toolkit normally would have multiple model classes based on the same table and then some models which relies on tables with joins or additional expressions. Expression, join and sub-query support is seriously lacking in other frameworks and ORMs.</p>

<p>Another benefit of Agile Toolkit model approach is security. Model level conditions is the best way to implement user data access restrictions or handling multiple states of data records.</p>

<p>Finally â€” Models of Agile Toolkit contain meta-information about your model fields, such as caption, validations, visibility rules and so on. As a result, many Views can read model definitions and build themselves based on that information.</p>

<p>Business-logic validation is often handled by the model. The User Interface performs validation through AJAX requests, so it's consistent, not duplicated, and not carried outside of the server-side code. If more developers start working on your software, you will want some of them to focus on Models, others on User Interface.</p>

<h2>What can a Model on its own?</h2>
<p>First, models can be used directly to manipulate database data. Here are some examples:</p>

<?Code?>
// Initialize object for employee
$emp=$this->add('Model_Employee');

// Load data for a given id
$emp->load($_GET['id']);

// Interact with data
$salary = $emp['salary'];

// Traverse foreign keys. Automatically loads proper model and data
$company=$emp->ref('company_id');

// a Model can define custom actions.
$company->letGo($emp);

// Standard actions can also be used
$emp->delete();

// Traversing foreign keys can happeen both ways
$emps = $company->ref('Employee');

// a Model can produce dynamic queries for any actions
$count = $emps->count()->getOne();

// You can use a customized model to create a fully functional CRUD capable of
// not only listing filtered records but also adding them to match the conditions:
$this->add('CRUD')->setModel($emps);

      <h4>Direct use of Models</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Define all the fields of the model and the type of those fields</li>
        <li>Completely define model-related business logic inside the model body</li>
        <li>Provide and encourage inheritance of models: User, User_Expired, User_Admin etc</li>
        <li>Implement two-way references between models</li>
        <li>When it comes to SQL, the model can use either single or multiple tables to store data (joins)</li>
        <li>Provide the ability for the model to add mandatory conditions to SQL tables</li>
        <li>Track which fields are changed</li>
        <li>Encourage model-level validation and default values</li>
        <li>Allow adding behaviours, either manually inside model functions or as extensions</li>
        <li>Support SQL expressions fields</li>
        <li>Offer extensions such as strong encryptions, audit log, timestamps, soft delete, and so on</li>
        <li>Contain custom methods for business operations</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Interface integration features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Bind Form with Model. It will populate field, validation, conditions and will offer to save form data automatically through model</li>
        <li>Bind Grid with Model. Displays properly formatted fields, both physical, calculated, foreign and related</li>
        <li>Define which fields and in which order you want to show when binding</li>
        <li>Add more fields, more conditions or even remove fields before you bind with the view</li>
        <li>Use custom controller when binding. This can allow you implement custom layouts or field arrangements</li>
        <li>Validation exceptions inside models bubble up to the view and displayed as pretty errors</li>
        <li>After binding with model, tweak dynamic SQL statement even more, such as by joining to more tables</li>
        <li>All user interface can also work with non-relational models</li>
      </ul>
