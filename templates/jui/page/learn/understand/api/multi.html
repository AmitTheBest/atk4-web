        <h1>Structuring multi-API application</h1>
        <p>There are several cases when it makes sense to create multiple API classes. Below are few typical scenarios.
        Because some functionality might be needed throughout all APIs it's incorporated into System Controller.</p>

        <h3>Multiple Interfaces</h3>
        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/multiapi.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Most of the web packages will be using multiple web interfaces. User Front-End and Admin are Web interfaces which
        take advantage of page concept. Then there are usually some command-line utilities which are designed for doing a
        single purpose such as cron-job or command-line manipulations.</p>

        <h3>Multi-lingual or satellite sites</h3>
        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/satellite.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>Sometimes you will want a software which runs in multiple regions mostly without changes, however you wish to
        preserve the flexibility to add regional or site specific changes. In this case you will want to create intermediate
        API which is then extended for each site.</p>

        <p>Site1 and Site2 classes can change theme, skin or add additional template/translations for localization.</p>

        <h3>Specific Applications</h3>
        <p>If your Agile Toolkit-based software requires installation, you would want to create a simple interface which can
        help user to set up your Web Software. You might want to create a new API for installer in general, then extend it to
        customize it with your installation steps. This way you can share generic installer class with community or with
        other projects while retaining flexibility of customization.</p>
