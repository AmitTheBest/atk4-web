        <h1>Execution of API class</h1>
        <img src="<?template?>images/ugly_images/apiseq.png<?/?>" style="float: right">
        <p>API of Agile Toolkit splits the whole execution of application into 2 parts. The first part deals with
        initialization of the objects and coupling them with proper models. The second part is an execution part and it will
        cause objects to query database, iterate through results, render and output output.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit objects never output anything directly, instead they insert their output into parent's template. API
        sends combined output to user's browser through "echo".</p>

        <h3>Initialization</h3>
        <p>Depending on which API you are using they will initialize several sub-components which call Controllers. When you
        are extending API class, you should re-define init() function and add initialization in there, things like connecting
        to the database, adding controllers, etc.</p>

        <p>ApiFrontend will automatically initialize Logger() which makes error logging more bearable.</p>

        <h3>Layouts</h3>
        <p>Layout is a region in the shared template (shared.html) which is used by API class. If region is defined, then a
        respective layout function is called.</p>

        <p>The first and most significant layout element is "Content". Content will determine which page is requested and
        proceed with all the logic of page initialization. However if "Content" is not present in API's template, page will
        not be initialized.</p>

        <p>You can add additional layout elementns. For example calling addLayout('Menu') inside api->init() will instruct
        API to call layout_Menu() method if tag &lt;?Menu?&gt; is found in the template.</p>

        <p>This approach can be used to initialize certain things such as side-bars, tool-bars and widgets if they exist
        inside API's template. You can manipulate different templates from inside defaultTemplate() function of your API.</p>

        <h3>Initializing Auth and checking Auth</h3>
        <p>While you can also execute auth->check() inside init(), we recommend performing auth-check inside initLayout()
        function:</p>
<?Code?>
    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $this->add('BasicAuth')->allow('john','secret');
    }
    function initLayout(){
        $this->auth->check();
        parent::initLayout();

        // Replace "login" link region with logout/user info
        if($this->auth->isLoggedIn()){
            $this->add('View',null,'UserMenu','view/usermenu/loggedin')
                ->set($this->auth->get()));
        }
    }
<?/?>
        <p>Did you notice that call to auth->check() is done before calling parent::initLayout()? That's because we do not
        want any pages to be initialized before authentication is checked.</p>

        <h3>Form Submission</h3>
        <p>Form submission is normally handled after all other views are initialized. When form is submitted, the rendering
        phase is skipped also. Submission occurs only if the form with a proper ID has been found.</p>


        <h3>Rendering</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit provides support for partial rendering of views based on 3 criteria: cut_page - outputs only page's
        content, cut_object - output content of certain object and cut_region - outputs content of certain region. This is
        explained in more depth later</p>

        <h3>Interrupting initialization phase</h3>
        <p>It is possible to interrupt execution of init() phase. This might be necessary if you wish to avoid any more
        objects to be added into the from some view. To terminate execution of init</p>
<?Code?>
// from inside View

// if product is not selected:

if(!$product){
    $this->add('ProductSelector');
    throw $this->exception('Stop showing page until product is selected','StopInit');
        // throws Exception_StopInit
}
<?/?>
        <p>This approach should be used only if calling "return" is not sufficient. That is from either a view which has been
        placed inside page or if your page extends other, common abstract page.</p>
