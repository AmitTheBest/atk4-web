        <h1>Models</h1>
        <p>Models is yet another gem of Agile Toolkit. Implementation of Models in Agile Toolkit is lightweight, very intuitive and elegant way to define your business logic.</p>

        <p>If you have used ORMs before, you would probably find Agile Toolkit Models more self-sufficient, often incorporating some of the controller logic and designed to keep objects in your application securely separated and organised.</p>

        <p>Use of Models in Agile Toolkit is optional, but very highly recommended for anything more sophisticated than a contact form.</p>
