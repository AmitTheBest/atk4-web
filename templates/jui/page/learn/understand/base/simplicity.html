        <h1>How Agile Toolkit keeps PHP Simple?</h1>
        <p>The PHP language packs an insane amount of features. When all of them are mashed together, your code starts to look complex, creepy and very Java-like. Agile Toolkit specifically tries to avoid some of the features, and tones down some other features.</p>

        <h2>PHP5 Features Agile Toolkit avoids using</h2>
        <p>Below are the list of features and concepts which Agile Toolkit avoids, as well as the reasoning behind the decision:</p>

        <h3>Command-line code generation</h3>
        <p>There is no magic command-line utility to generate a bunch of code on your behalf. Generation of repeated code is a violation
        of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. It also often adds stuff to your project that you are not aware of, but
        which you will need to continue to maintain.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit provides many ways to simplify your project structure and reduce the amount of code you will
        need to write, therefore code generation is not needed.</p>

        <h3>Singletons</h3>
        <p>Singletons are evil. Especially in PHP. They give no benefits, not even memory saving. They might have some use in
        Java, but are generally considered a bad design in PHP software.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit never relies on singletons. As a result, you may create two or more instances of API, completely
        independently. "Controllers" can only be added once into the parent, but having them in each copy of the API makes sense.
        Consider the example, where clicking a link in the Admin system logs you into the Frontend as a specific user. The most 
        correct way to implement this is to initialize a Frontend API along with its Auth, and log the user there directly.</p>

        <h3>Protected and Private properties</h3>
        <p>Access restriction is a way to tell users "keep away from the core". Unfortunately PHP does not implement any
        support which would allow specific classes (friendly as in C++ or package as in Java) access to those
        properties.</p>

        <p>Agile Toolkit keeps properties and functions public. Even though you might not need to call them, some Controller
        may use them directly to enhance functionality of an object in a certain context.</p>

        <h3>Setters and Getters</h3>
        <p>There is a school of thought that all properties should be declared as 'private', and should only be accessible through
        accessor functions such as getMyProperty / setMyProperty. This principle seems to work fine in the C language, which can optimize
        the use of those functions to the same level as accessing the properties directly. In PHP, using this approach slows
        down both the development and execution slightly.</p>

        <p>In Agile Toolkit you will often see the use of $obj->set() and $obj->get() methods, which functionally vary
        depending on the object type. Usually those methods deal with complex logic, such as setting tag values in templates. Do not be
        afraid to access properties directly.</p>

        <p>The exception is in field definitions for Models, which use functions primarily for chaining.</p>

        <h3>Long variable or class names</h3>
        <p>Typing long variable names takes time. Methods, classes and properties in Agile Toolkit use compact names
        to produce as little code as possible. However all methods must be meaningful.</p>

        <h3>Namespaces</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit uses namespaces for add-ons. It is to avoid class name collisions between different add-ons and base
        classes. Read add-on development guide for more information.</p>


        <h2>Features to be careful about</h2>

        <h3>IDEs and code type hinting</h3>
        <p>Some of the constructions in Agile Toolkit make it impossible for type hinting to work correctly in IDEs. In some
        instances, a comment suggesting a variable type may be used, for example, with the add() function, which may help
        code hinting to work in the IDE:
<?Code?>
/* @var $form Form */
$form=$page->add('Form');
$f->addFi.. /* completion works */

<?/?>

        <p>PHP is a loosely typed language, and Agile Toolkit takes advantage of that. IDEs were initially designed for
        languages such as C++ or Java and struggle to properly understand PHP. Rely on your common sense and Reference documentation. 
        If you can't give up code completion, you should perhaps look into other programming languages.</p>

        <h3>Interfaces</h3>
        <p>An Interface is a design feature in PHP, by which you can set the requirements for class implementation. While it might have some
        use when designing software architecture, it has little use in Agile Toolkit.</p>  

        <p>Said that, in a normal model design you will find it very useful to use type hinting</p>
<?Code?>
// class "User"
function purchaseTicket(Model_Bus_Route $route){
  //..
}
<?/?>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit implements certain model hooks such as beforeSave or beforeDelete. You may add tiny methods there which perform
        a validation check and throw errors.</p>
<?Code?>
$model->addHook('beforeSave',function($m){
  if($m['age']<18)throw $m->exception('Must be 18+')->addMoreInfo('age',$m['age']);
});
<?/?>

        <h3>Localization</h3>
        <p>Agile Toolkit provides great means for you to supply localization. Override api->_() method which should translate output of
        Agile Toolkit into your language. You can gettext, SQL or any other technique for providing string translations. Agile Toolkit will
        route exceptions through this function.
