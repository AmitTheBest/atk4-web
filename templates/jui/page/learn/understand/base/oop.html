<h1>Knowledge Requirements</h1>
<p>How much you must know before you start using Agile Toolkit and what will Agile Toolkit teach you?</p>

<p>Agile Toolkit is used to power many high end projects and it does not lack in flexibility or power. Nevertheless, developing 
with Agile Toolkit is much simpler than developing with plain PHP alone. Once you start using Agile Toolkit, it's unlikely that 
you'll want to mess with things on the low level of PHP again. It makes a great deal of sense to skip some low-level stuff
and get real results quick.</p>

<p>It seems that some PHP frameworks require their developers to know web development process already. <b>You do not need to
  learn how to develop web applications WITHOUT frameworks before learning Agile Toolkit</b>. If you never made a web application,
Agile Toolkit is a great way to build your first one.</p>

<h2>Learn to program</h2>
<p>Take a programming course and learn how to use variables, iterations, loops and ethods. You does not necesserily have to learn
programming in PHP, it can be other language. The important skills you will need is ability to plan your code and refactor it.</p>

<h2>Learn PHP</h2>
<p>You do need to know about PHP expressions, variables, control structures and logical operators. So if you don't, <a
  href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php">start reading the PHP language reference</a>. You might want to skip the features
which Agile Toolkit does not use (I have mentioned them in the previous section)</p>

<h2>Object-Oriented Programming Training</h2>
<p>Apart from the syntax, you need to understand how objects work. Look for some on-line documentation on Object-Oriented Programming 
for more information. You will need to understand the difference between a Class and an Object, how class inheritance works, and how 
you can override methods. Some experience in object-oriented development is really beneficial when using Agile Toolkit, even if you used
a language other than PHP. If you have developed any desktop application in Java or ObjectiveC, you will feel "at home" with Agile
Toolkit.</p>

<h2>Understanding Performance</h2>
<p>There are many ways how fast programming language, framework or library can be slowed down by improper coding practices. Web
applications are especially sensitive to poor coding skills.</p>

<p>In this book I will continue to point out important points which will help you develop high-performance and scalable applications.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for naming methods</h2>
<p>Apart from what was explained above, there are other guidelines and principles you should follow when creating methods:</p>

<h3>Prefix dynamically-executed methods</h3>

<p>Agile Toolkit uses camelCase method naming. When methods are called dynamically, they should be prefixed with a keyword and an underscore. For example: if you want to add a page into the API, your method would start with "page_".Similarly you would use "page_" for sub-pages, "layout_" for ApiFrontend layouts, and so on.</p>

<h2>Method visibility</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of Agile Toolkit, you will find most of the methods and properties defined as public. This is because some of the controllers require access to those methods and properties, and there is no way to define a "Friendly" class in PHP. Use your common sense when programming. Don't start manually creating objects and adding them into $obj->elements[] just because the elements array is public.</p>
