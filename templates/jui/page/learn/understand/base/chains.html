        <h1>Chaining method calls</h1>
        <p>There are no procedures in PHP and all the functions return something. When object's method has nothing
        meaning-full to return, it returns same object back - $this. Methods like that are considered chain-able because
        return of one method can be used to call further methods.</p>

        <p>This approach is used a lot in practice and often improves code readability. You won't need those extra temporary
        variables anymore. Below are some examples of code chaining in Agile Toolkit.</p>

<?Code?>
$users = $this->api->db->dsql()
        ->table('user')
        ->where('age>',30)
        ->order('name')
        ->do_getAllHash();
