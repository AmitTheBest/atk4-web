      <p><b>Important:</b> Be sure to use proper upper/lower case for your files and classes.</p>
      <p><b>Important:</b> If an example asks you to create a view/test.php file, create a "view" folder if it does not exist.</p>
      <p><b>Important:</b> When creating PHP files, be sure to add <b>&lt;?php</b> at the start.</p>

    <p>While you are trying to learn Agile Toolkit, let's keep it fun and informal. But first - the good news:</p>

    <h3>Examples are as easy as they look</h3>

    <p>Have you ever tried to follow a web tutorial? They ask you to create a HTML file first then a PHP file then JavaScript files and possible CSS files. You might not even understand what are theese files. In Agile Toolkit it's different. To get something done, you just need to copy-paste some code into your PHP file. Until you are skilled enough to understand, you will not need to go into the unknown territory.</p>

    <p>Do not hesitate to copy-paste any example into your local installation of Agile Toolkit. You'll find out that button shape, layout or font-size may differ to match the configuration of your own environment, but the result and logic will remain the same.</p>

    <p>If you decided to create an application in Agile Toolkit to learn it better, don't focus on small details from the start. Get the business logic and the presentation logic working. Learn to use components Agile Toolkit gives you â€” on at a time. Later you will learn how to extend and change things into any imaginable shape, but it might not be an easy task now.</p>
