        <p>Object Structure in Agile Toolkit is ... life-changing!</p>

        <p>Any visual element, existent or new, provides a high level of abstraction to hide technical details from developer
        and provide a clean and very powerful object-oriented interface.</p>

        <p>How about example first? Please keep in mind that the example only touches surface of the UI-layer in Agile
        Toolkit. There are many features such as Models (MVC), ORM, Dynamic SQL and add-ons which are explained later.</p>

        your own copy of Agile Toolkit.</p>
