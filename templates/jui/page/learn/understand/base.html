<h1>Learning should be fun!</h1>

        <p>While you are trying to learn Agile Toolkit, let's keep it fun and less formal. But first - the good news:</p>

        <h3>Examples are as easy as they look</h3>

        <p>Have you seen those blogs which teach you to do things? You follow the advise and create 5 files do multiple tweaks and then finally you can see some result?</p>

        <p>Examples in Agile Toolkit documentation are <b>different</b>. They are short and compact. Except Agile Toolkit you don't need to have antyhing. If you have gone through installation documentation, you would know <a href="<?page?>learn/install/how<?/?>">where to put your example code</a>.</p>
        </p>

        <p>Do not hestitate to copy-paste any example into your local installation of Agile Toolkit. You'll find out that button shape, layout or font-size may differ to match configuration of your environment, but the result and logic remains the same</p>
