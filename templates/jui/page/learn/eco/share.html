        <h1>Contribute and Share</h1>


        <h3>Spread a word</h3>
        <p>Tweet, mention, suggest or share your thoughts about Agile Toolkit. That's the most essential help you can give to
        us right now. Also please provide feedback.</p>

        <h3>Post a blog post</h3>
        <p>We and others love hearing about your fortune or misfortune with trying out Agile Toolkit. Write a blog post <a 
        href="http://blog.wilgucki.pl/2011/05/hello-world-w-agile-toolkit.html">(like this)</a> about your experience. Even
        if it was a bumpy ride for you, share it anyway, we want to know and improve it</p>

        <h3>Make an free addon</h3>
        <p>Sharing code is really simple in Agile Toolkit. If you have built a new View class. How about Treeview? Suppose
        you have made one. Contribute your code back and it will be a part of atk4-addons. Addons are distributed under MIT
        license and therefore can be used by commercial and open-source users.</p>

        <p>Your addon could be a more complex and consist of multiple components. Remember, that users of Agile Toolkit like
        simplicity, so do not overcomplicate things. Integrate and re-use as much as you can. We would try to help you
        improve the code if needed, but it should be properly structured.</p>


        <h3>Make your app Open-Source</h3>
        <p>Upload your application to github an share code with everyone. <a href="https://github.com/agiletech/colubris">We
        did it ourselves</a>. Colubris is the project we use internally but we are also willing to make it possible for
        others to use it and possibly even improve it.</p>

        <p>We know that maintaining open-source project is not easy, that's why we are going to help. Follow standard
        practices of web development with Agile Toolkit as described in documentation, we will help you with generic install
        instructions and other goodies.</p>

        <p>PHP community must share more good-quality code. If you are writing community portal or even just learning, don't
        keep code to yourself. If you plan to charge your users in the future having your code public on-line will not makee
        your on-line service less valuable.</p>

        <h3>Make commercial product</h3>
        <p>If you are holder of commercial or educational license, you can develop and distribute your product. You can also bundle Agile
        Toolkit with it. There are no restrictions regarding how much copies you distribute or how many servers you run. The
        more the better.</p>

        <p>We are willing to help you promote your product and the community which has formed around Agile Toolkit could be
        the most suitable audience. Until our community portal is ready - use our contact form to tell us about your product.
        We will endorse it and possibly even help you sell it in near future.</p>
        
        <p>There are developers who turn away from Agile Toolkit due to licensing. Developers who expect all the software to
        be free. That's fine, because we are focused on those, who can apprechiate the value of intellectual property, who
        earn money through development work and who just like us wish to be paid for a good quality product.</p>
