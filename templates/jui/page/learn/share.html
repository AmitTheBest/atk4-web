<h3>Sharing Your Code</h3>
<p>Your project code might be very valuable for other developers who are only learning Agile Toolkit. The free license of Agile Toolkit (AGPL) prompts you to share your application code with your users or with the community.

<p>If you think that your code is of a low quality, put that into the comments and share it anyway. Someone might actually help you by cleaning it up!</p>
