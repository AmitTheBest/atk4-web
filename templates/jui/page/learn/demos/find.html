        <h1>Where to find demos and examples?</h1>
        <p>As mentioned previously, many examples will appear on documentation and introduction pages.
        Additionally you can find examples on <a href="http://demo.atk4.com/demo.html">demo.atk4.com</a>.
        Another location for examples is <a href="<?page?>example/list<?/page?>">Examples page on agiletoolkit.org</a>.</p>


        <h3>Codepad</h3>
        <p>There is a codepad.agiletoolkit.org which is used by the core team to link to some samples exactly. Codepad is
        available from Git and you can install it on your own server and share links with others. Sample page is:
        <a href="http://codepad.agiletoolkit.org/issue12?b=devel">http://codepad.agiletoolkit.org/issue12?b=devel</a>. If you
        omit "?b=devel" option, 4.0 version of Agile Toolkit will be used instead of 4.1.
