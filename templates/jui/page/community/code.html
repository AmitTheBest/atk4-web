<h1>Sharing your code</h1>
<p>Many of the PHP developers have very little experience with social code development. Code sharing is what makes frameworks such as Ruby on Rails strong and united. With Agile Toolkit we aim to pursue the same goals.</p>

<p>We encourage you to signup with <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> - a social coding engine and publish any projects you work on. It will make it much easier for other developers to suggest you how to improve your project or for you to get any help. That will also be helpful for others who are following in your foot-steps and starting to learn about Agile Toolkit.</p>

<h3>Uploading your code</h3>
<p>If you are on a Mac, there is an amazing official client for Github. For a Windows users there is an amazing guide on how to set up Git client with GitHub.
