My company produces around 10-20 web projects per year for small companies and web entrepreneurs. Our clients, often business-oriented, are busy chasing investors and winning awards, while we are looking after their Web Software. However interacting with them is very important and we are looking for a better ways to do so.
</p><p>
Since we are developing web-software, why not use that web-software to interact with the client? In this article I am explaining how to go through a steps to develop a simple yet robust feedback system.
</p>

<h3>What will you need?</h3>
<p>
All the web software we are developing is based on Agile Toolkit. It is a platform which makes building of Web UI much easier and more consistent, while also looking at business logic structure in a very modern object-oriented fashion (<a href="http://agiletoolkit.org/">http://agiletoolkit.org/</a>).
</p>
<p>
You will also need to have a on-going project with a couple of pages.  For my testing page, I have chosen a sign-up form for our up-coming project.
</p>
<h3>Adding a button</h3>
<p>I wanted to have a minimum impact on the page layout / design, therefore I decided to add a button on the page which would open the frame.
</p>

<?Code?>
$p->add('Button')->setLabel('Feedback for this page')
    ->js('click')->univ()->dialogURL('Feedback',$this->api->getDestinationURL(null,
        array('discuss'=>true)),array('buttons'=>false,'width'=>'500x'));
<?/?>

<p>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-428 alignleft" style="float: right; border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em;" title="Screen shot 2011-03-10 at 23.37.16" src="http://agiletoolkit.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-10-at-23.37.16-300x158.png" alt="" width="300" height="158">
This code creates button and binds click event on it. Whenever clicked it will open jQuery UI dialog with the same page it’s placed on, however with additional get argument: <br/> <i>"?discuss=true"</i></p>

<h3>Creating a Model</h3>
<p>
In development branch of Agile Toolkit it’s no longer mandatory to create Controllers for each Model. Therefore I have only created a model.
</p><p>
Model represent a logical record in the database, describes it’s relations, fields, conditions, validations as well as possible actions. In my case I have created 4 fields in the model:
</p>
<?Code?>
class Model_Feedback extends Model_Table {
    public $entity_code='feedback';
    public $table_alias='fb';

    function init(){
        parent::init();
        $this->addField('name')->caption('Your Name');
        $this->addField('page')->system(true);
        $this->addField('descr')->caption('Suggestion or Feedback')->datatype('text');
        $this->addField('date')->system(true)->defaultValue(date('Y-m-d'));
    }
}
<?/?>
<p>
Reference will be the way how I tie certain feedback to my pages and date will be captured and saved without user having to enter it. Next I went to add the form into the new pop-up.
</p>
<h3>Frame for collecting feedback</h3>
<p>
Function univ().dialogURL(title,url) in Agile Toolkit creates a jQuery UI dialog with specified title and loads specified URL in the frame. URL is automatically appended with the “cut_page”, which will make sure that standard header/footer of my page is not showing up on the frame. The sub-request is executed with argument ?discuss=true therefore I need to intercept that and add a feedback form instead.
<p>
<?Code?>
if($_GET['discuss']){
    $p=$p->add('View','feedback');$_GET['cut_object']=$p->name;
    $this->api->stickyGET('discuss');
    $f=$p->add('MVCForm');
    $f->setModel('Feedback')->setMasterField('page',$this->api->page);
    if($f->isSubmitted()){
        $f->update();
        $f->js()->univ()->successMessage('Thank you')->closeDialog()->execute();
    }
    return;
}
<?/?>
<p>

<img style="float: right; border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em;" class="size-medium wp-image-438" title="Screen shot 2011-03-11 at 00.32.40" src="http://agiletoolkit.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-11-at-00.32.40-300x152.png" alt="" width="300" height="152">
I have inserted this code right before the code which adds button. Additionally I created a View which I automatically force being cut form the page. This approach is a little messy, however it works quite well. Next I need to create table in SQL:
</p>
<pre>
create table feedback (
	id int auto_increment not null primary key, 
	name varchar(255), page varchar(255), 
	descr text, date varchar(255) ); 
</pre>
<p>
This worked perfectly. Clicking buttong brings a neat frame up for entering feedback. Result is saved into the database.
</p>
<p>
The best part is that the code is easily portable into any software which is using Agile Toolkit. For example I have also added the same code into THIS page. 
Due to a different theme it has a different look then on the screenshots, however the behaviour is identical.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy and if you like it, copy the code to your own Agile Toolkit application.

<?Example?>
$this->api->dbConnect();
if($_GET['discuss']){
    $p=$p->add('View','feedback');
	$_GET['cut_object']=$p->name;
    $this->api->stickyGET('discuss');
    $f=$p->add('MVCForm');
    $f->setModel('Feedback')
		->setMasterField('page',$this->api->page);
    if($f->isSubmitted()){
        $f->update();
        $f->js()->univ()
			->successMessage('Thank you')
			->closeDialog()->execute();
    }
    return;
}
$p->add('Button')
	->setLabel('Feedback for this page')
    ->js('click')->univ()->dialogURL('Feedback',
		$this->api->getDestinationURL(null,
       array('discuss'=>true)),
		array('buttons'=>false,'width'=>'500px'));
