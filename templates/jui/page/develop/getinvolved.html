<p>We are willing to put community drive behind Agile Toolkit. There are recruiting help on multiple levels.
Regardless of your experience there are many ways how you can help</p>
<p>Our goal is to promote PHP as a competitive enterprise platform yet bringing it's own unique benefits such as simplicity, efficiency and speed</p>

<h2>Adopt Agile Toolkit in your company</h2>
<p>We love open-source and we love PHP. Unfortunately apart from some software applications, PHP is not regarded in enterprise as a serious language. We intend to change that by offering a really solid platform focused on many business needs yet exceedingly efficient, fast and secure.</p>
<p>If your company produces Web software, consider using Agile Toolkit. If your business environment has some requirements which Agile Toolkit can't meet, please let us know</p>

<h2>Promoting Affero GPL Software</h2>
<p>Affero GPL v3 is a license which makes sure that any software built on it remains open-source. Unlike other web frameworks which allow closed-source development, we are willing more and more software being built on ATK4 and have it's source code released. If your company needs to build some internal software, you would not loose anything if it would be open-sourced.</p>
<p>Consider about licensing your project with AGPL. Even if it's a private venture, it makes a lot of sense to release open-source version for your product promotion.</p>

<h2>Add-on Developers</h2>
<p>Agile Toolkit makes it extremely easy to develop add-ons. Practically anything you develop can easy be distributed as an addon. See our <a href="addons.html">addon development section</a> and learn how easy it is to share parts of your project with community.</p>
