<h2>Promoting Affero GPL Software</h2>
<p>Affero GPL v3 is a license which makes sure that any software built on it remains open-source. Unlike other web frameworks which allow closed-source development, we would like more and more software to be built on ATK4 as open-source software. released. If your company is build some internal software, and you would not loose anything if was open-source, consider licensing your project with AGPL. Even with commmercial software, it may make sense to release an open-source version as part of your product strategy.</p>
