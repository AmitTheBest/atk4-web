<h1>Web User Interface</h1>

<p>From all the toolkits who attempted to create User Interface you will find Agile Toolkit to be the slickest, the most flexible and the most full-featured. To find out why, let's look at how the Form is implemented in Agile Toolkit.</p>

<p>The standard PHP class Form relies on different assets outside of PHP to make your form look great. Agile Toolkit forms are enhanced with a built-in jQuery UI widget (ui.atk4_form.js) which adds AJAX form submission, field reloading, lovely validation error reporting and flexible handling of successful form submission. Form also relies on the CSS framework which allows developer to customize layout and look of the form. Arranging fields in two or three columns no longer requires you to fiddle with HTML code.</p>

<p>Form relies on a template, which defines the actual HTML used by form and fields. Finally there are several Controllers you can apply to a form such as controller for CSF protection, password strength indicator. Using Form with a Model will spawn MVCForm controller which will bind Form with Model and automatically populate fields while converting field types.</p>

<p>Form does not implement all the functionality on it's own. It relies on different Field classes and Button class to render itself. Form, as any other View can have events. onSubmit() is one form-specific event, but many others can be added through JavaScript interaction class jUI.</p>

<p>It is not a goal of Agile Toolkit to eliminate access to HTML completely. If bundled form CSS styles are not suitable, you can build your own layout through a simple HTML template.</p>

<h4>SMLite - Agile's approach to Template Objects</h4>
<p>Template is a common practice to separate HTML markup from business logic. Unfortunately popular template engines such as Smarty have decided to implement a new programming language inside a template. Agile Toolkit Templates reverse this pattern and make templates incredibly simple. Consider the following example:</p>

<div class="atk_doc example"><code>
  Templates are <font color="red">&lt;?tag?&gt;</font><font color="blue">simple</font><font color="red">&lt;?/?&gt;</font>
</code></div>

<p>The above string is a valid template in Agile Toolkit. You can manipulate tag values by manipulating them.</p>

<?Code?>
echo $tpl->set('tag','powerful')->render();  // outputs "Templates are powerful"
<?/?>

<p>This is as simple as templates can get. It is also all we need from the template engine â€” ability to get and set region values. This simplicity is significant to the way how templates are used by the User Interface.</p>

<h2>View - your Window into HTML Widget</h2>
<?Execute?>
$view = $page->add('Alex');
<?/?>
<p>The web page you see in front of you consists of Views. View are implemented as objects and each view display a rectangular block on the web page. Above there was a Menu object. Below are some Form objects but to the right of this paragraph you will see a custom-made View implemented as a class "Alex".</p>

<p>Every object is capable of producing a chunk of HTML code which fits inside it's parent. Objects are rendered recursively by Agile Toolkit. Most of the objects rely on SMLite template to get the actual HTML code they need to output.</p>

<?Code?>
$view = $page->add('Alex');
<?/?>

<p>The code above is the fundamental building block of your application in Agile Toolkit. You don't work with HTML, you work with objects. Agile Toolkit is bundled with many cool objects and in every application you are building, you'll be adding more of your own Views. Often views rely on custom SMlite template and incorporate other objects into that template. Together you get a consistent, unified and simple User Interface.</p>

<h3>View + jQuery UI Widget = Love</h3>
<p>Once you are focused on a small portion of your page, the ability to communicate between that PHP class and the web browser becomes very essential. Agile Toolkit provides the means to communicate between jQuery UI Widget for the "Form" view and the PHP Class absolutely transparently using AJAX.</p>

<?Example?>
$form = $page->add('Form');
$form->addField('line','name')->setNotNull();
$form->addSubmit('Greet');

if($form->isSubmitted()){
    $form->js()->univ()
        ->alert('Hello, '.$form->get('name'))
        ->execute();
}
