<h1>Toolkit Add-ons</h1>
<p>Agile Toolkit takes a great pride in how extensible it is. There are many powerful add-ons for the Agile Toolkt that you can use in your own commercial or open-source projects. You can also contribute add-ons to the Agile Toolkit community and if they meet coding standards, we will publish them on our website</p>
<h2>Good Quality Add-ons</h2>
<p>"When I use some other frameworks my frustration was that I had to develop everything myself. There were some add-ons but they were of a poor quality and they didn't fit into my application at all. Authors had different licenses and were often lacking updates, which caused a lot of trouble for our commercial projects. And when we tried to modify them ourselves, we discovered a lot of spaghetti code." Romans Malinovskis, CTO Agile Technologies</p>

<p>Through compliance with Agile Toolkit Coding Standards you will make it very easy to integrate third party Add-ons or t create your own.

The Agile Toolkit approach, ideals and techniques are a little different from other libraries and frameworks. Once you are familiar with those, you will find working with Agile Toolkit <b>faster</b>, <b>simpler</b>, and more <b>addictive</b>. Our Interactive Introduction will go through concepts step-by-step and introduce you with the basics of Agile Toolkit.</p>

<h2>Learning from Examples</h2>
<p>Conventions is what makes Agile Toolkit simple. Once you can see through the conventions, even features you never used before will be familiar to you from the first glance.
