<h1>Toolkit Extensions</h1>
<p>Agile Toolkit takes a great pride in how extensible it is. Flexibility and choice is one of the core goals of Agile Toolkit. In your own projects - be they commercial or open-source always look for opportunity to use those extensions. At the same time, try to convert your software into extension and if they meet coding standards, we will publish them on our website</p>
<h2>Good Quality Extensions</h2>
<p>When I have used some other frameworks my frustration was that I had to develop everything myself. There were some add-ons but they were of a poor quality and they didn't fit into my application at all. Authors had different licensing and were not prompt with updates causing a lot of trouble for our commercial projects. And when we tried to modify them ourselves, we discovered a lot of spaghetti code.</p>

<p>Through compliance with Agile Toolkit Coding Standards you will make it very easy to integrate third party extensions or create your own. 

Agile Toolkit approach, ideals and techniques are different from other libraries and frameworks. Once you are familiar with those, you will find working with Agile Toolkit <b>faster</b>, <b>simpler</b>, and more <b>addictive</b>. Our Interactive Introduction will go through concepts step-by-step and introduce you with the basics of Agile Toolkit.</p>
