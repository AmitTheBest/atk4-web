        <p>
		If you prefer to watch and listen, you can look through few of our fast-paced screen-casts (Some may use slightly older version of Agile Toolkit). You can help us by
		recording your own screen-casts and we will publish them in screen-cast section.</p>

		<h3>Examine Example Applications</h3>
<i class="big-icon icon-gears" style="float: left; padding: 4px; padding-right: 8px"></i>
		<p>There are several projects based on Agile Toolkit. Perhaps you would like to get under the hood and start looking
		at application code? Start with some simple examples and move on to complex projects such as AgileToolkit Web Site
		(yes, source code of this site) and Colubris.</p>
		<p><a href="<?page?>doc/project<?/?>">Examples and Production Software developed on Agile Toolkit</a>.</p>

		<!--
		For some "example" applications you should take a look at <a href="<?page?>doc/project/inviteme<?/?>">Invite-me
		Project</a>. It migth come handy next time Google might be offering invite-only service for requesting and sharing
		invites. There is also <a href="<?page?>doc/project/codepad<?/?>">Code-pad</a> if you want to show and share your code.</p>

		<p>
		There are full high-scale applications available under Open-Source license such as <a href="<?page?>doc/project/colubris<?/?>">Colubris Project</a>. This
		project implements advanced time-management system. <a href="<?page?>doc/project/atk4web<?/?>">This website is also
		written in Agile Toolkit</a>. It is more focused on presentation of information rather than interraction.

	<h4 style="color: red">Version 4.2 is Almost Here</h4>
    <p>Some of the fundamental classes for 4.1 were not implemented to high standards and have been refactored in the 4.2 version. We decided to put our efforts into documenting <b>Version 4.2</b> instead of finishing this old documentation section.</p>
