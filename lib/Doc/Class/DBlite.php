				DBlite class will allow your application to interact with SQL database. To define, which database type should
				be used (MySQL, PostrgreSQL, etc) as well as provide database access information, you need to supply DSN
				(Database Source Name).	Typically [DSN is supplied in configuration file].

				In typical applications you do not need to use DBlite class directly. Use [$api->dbConnect()] to establish
				connection automatically. This will ceate DBlite object, which will be accessible through $api->db property.

				It is strongly advised to used [DSQL class] for any database interactions. However, should you require direct
				database access, you may use DBlite directly.

				Finally - you can establish multiple connections to multiple databases by creating additional instances
				of DBlite.

					First - developer must write every single query himself. Toolkit can\'t help you by creating them
					automatically for you. 

					Secondly - once query is written and passed to a function, that function is no longer able to change it
					(for example to introduce additional WHERE clause or to JOIN related table).

					Finally - by asking developer to take care of all the SQL queries, due to human error, they may 
					introduce security risks, such as [SQL injections]. Parametric queries solve security issue, however they
					do nothing about first two issues.

					[Dynamic SQL] is a class instead of the string. After you create DSQL object, you can execute its methods
					to change the query. Similarly other components of the framework can do some adjustments for you.
					Arguments you pass to those methods are automatically validated / quoted as required.
