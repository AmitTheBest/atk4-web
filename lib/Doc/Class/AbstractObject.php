				a static content prepared by some tool which explains how UI looks on the screen. Model is either a data
				object or XML container also prepared and managed by some tool');

				However in a perfectly normal scenario it may happend that you need to execute a query while data is still
				being fetched. For that reason, all instant queries such as getOne or getAll as well as those performed
				through DSQL will not override current cursor.
